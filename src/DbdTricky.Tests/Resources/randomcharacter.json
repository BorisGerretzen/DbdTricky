Eventually, Jake rebelled by dropping out of school entirely.<br><br>Now, Jake lives off the grid on the edge of the woods. It\u2019s been years since he spoke to his father but his mother checks in once in a while. It was she who eventually called the police.<br><br>The cops said he got lost in the woods and a search party looked for days, but gave up as bad weather rolled in.
