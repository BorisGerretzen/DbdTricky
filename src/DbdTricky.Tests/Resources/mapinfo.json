    "description": "The half-forgotten temple complex dedicated to the cleansing of the High Priestess\u2019s followers. The vertiginous hypostyle hall was believed to hold the weight of the heavens.<br><br>Stolen from the memories of The Plague, the temple was planted in the howling Red Forest, whose winds eroded its smooth edges. It now stands as a beacon of fear, visible from all cardinal points.",
