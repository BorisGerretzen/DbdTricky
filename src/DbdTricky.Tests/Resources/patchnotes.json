Her commands are followed without question or delay.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Ability: Chase</strong></p>\n<p>The Chase Command sends the dog out at high speed. Pressing the Power button again redirects the Chase, pivoting the dog's path. When the dog catches a Survivor, the dog starts a Grab. The Survivor becomes Hindered and is pulled toward The Houndmaster. The Survivor can get free by stunning the dog or can be rescued by another Survivor. Grabs that end without Injury leave the Survivor Hindered. Grab duration is shorter for Survivors with the Endurance status effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Ability: Search</strong></p>\n<p>The Search Command sends the dog to a target location, creating a Search Path. It has its own lullaby and, as it moves, its Houndsense radius rises over distance traveled. Survivors who enter the radius are affected by Houndsense and revealed by Killer Instinct. If The Houndmaster follows the dog's Search Path, she gains increased movement speed over time. Leaving the Search Path ends the bonus movement speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Effect: Houndsense</strong></p>\n<p>Healthy Survivors affected by Houndsense receive Deep Wounds when Injured. Injured Survivors affected by Houndsense suffer from louder Grunts of Pain and longer Pools of Blood when put into the Dying state.</p>\n<h3>Perks:</h3>\n<p><strong>All-Shaking Thunder</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>After you fall from a height, your lunge attack distance is increased by 75/75/75% for 8/12/16 seconds.</li>\n<li>This perk has a 5/5/5-second cooldown.<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scourge Hook: Jagged Compass</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the start of the trial, up to 4 random hooks are changed into scourge hooks.

When you hook a Survivor on a Scourge Hook, the aura of the generator with the most progress is revealed in yellow for 6/8/10 seconds.<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>No Quarter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a Survivor reaches 75/75/75% of a self-heal, they are faced with continuous skill checks.</li>\n<li>If one of these skill checks is missed or the heal is interrupted, the Survivor becomes broken for 20/25/30 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Survivor - Taurie Cain</h2>\n<h3>Perks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Invocation: Treacherous Crows</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>When in the Basement near the circle, press the ability button 2 to begin the Invocation. Invocations take 60/60/60 seconds. Other Survivors will see your aura during this and can join an ongoing interaction. Once the Invocation is completed: Completing the Invocation disables that perk for all\u202fSurvivors.</li>\n<li>You become injured and broken for the rest of the trial.</li>\n<li>When a Survivor is in the Terror Radius and the Killer scares a crow, their aura is revealed to all Survivors for 1/1.5/2 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clean Break</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>After you finish healing another Survivor, while being healed by another Survivor, press the ability button 1 to become Broken.</li>\n<li>After 80/70/60 seconds, you become healthy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This perk does not activate if you are already broken.
