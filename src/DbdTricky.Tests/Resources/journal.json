Another book by what I presume to be the same author showcased sketches of abandoned towers just like this one in the middle of the abyss. Pierce believes we should form parties to search for them. I think they\u2019re just the sketches of a creative artist with lots of time on his hands.",

It seems to me that Jezabel and the Mad Designer are one and the same. She seems to have multiple personas and her designs seem to be quite bold and unrestricted. They are fun and horrific at the same time especially those that describes battles between towers. If there is any credibility to her sketches and notes, it would seem as though I was wrong and that there are several of these towers scattered throughout the abyss.",
