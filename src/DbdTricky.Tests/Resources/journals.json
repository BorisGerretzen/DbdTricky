Talbot writes about her in his notes. He believes she\u2019s one of the unknowns who went mad with the knowledge she possessed. According to him, she has no recollection of her past life or even her name. Barra described something similar. Same with Shelly, only Shelly refers to her as one of the guardians and believes she came from an advanced world much like my own. Baker, however, describes a powerful trickster who uses marooned survivors to collectively manifest her designs to impress or outdo The Entity, if that\u2019s even possible. He believed her realms existed outside the control of The Entity and could potentially poison the dimension if they were allowed to grow. Baker claims one or two victims contained the root of the memories being used to manifest her realm. Destroy the root, destroy the realm. I stared at these unsuspecting survivors and couldn\u2019t figure out who Zzzzl had chosen to manifest her design. I thought of hacking through them all, but then quickly realized that\u2019s probably why she lured me here, and I refused to give her the satisfaction.

                        "text": "<b>Stories from the Witch Caf\u00e9. The Forever Horror.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone! Please enjoy today's special, Pumpkin Ghoul Pie with, may I suggest, a cup of Franken Spice Coffee while I do my best to entertain you with tonight's story. This one comes from a challenge I received from friends to tell a scary story that could go on forever. I'm not sure if it's as scary as it's gross, but it's certainly fitting for Halloween and it takes place in Medieval, Europe. I call this one, Tiny Awful Things, but my friends are telling me I should probably call it, The Forever Horror. Have a listen and let's discuss afterwards.<br><br>There was no doubt: Lucian was a coward. He was strong and clever and fast, but a coward, nevertheless. That's what made being drafted into the king's army and marched into battle all the worse. Not wanting to put himself in harm's way, Lucian thought of a clever plan to avoid injury or even death.<br><br>As soon as the horns blared and the infantry charged into the fray, Lucian executed his cowardly plan. He let loose a war-cry like none other, rushed forward with his sword raised, then, when no one was looking, when he heard the clash of iron and the agonizing screams of dying soldiers, he made himself tumble to the ground where he played dead and hoped for the best.<br><br>Lucian was so scared that despite the stink of rotting humanity he kept his eyes closed for several days until he felt someone or something tapping his shoulder. When he opened his eyes, he found himself staring up at a man in dark robes, holding a bloody scythe.<br><br>Lucian was staring at Death.<br><br>Or, at least, that's what he thought.<br><br>Actually, it wasn't Death at all, but a lower dimensional demon making the rounds, making mischief, pretending to be Death, looking for someone, anyone, to torment. And if you know anything about lower dimensional demons you know that they absolutely delight in tormenting cowards\u2014cowards and narcissists.<br><br>And so, this lower dimensional demon stared at Lucian with glowing red eyes and told him his time had come and asked if he had any last requests. Lucian, of course, extended a trembling hand and begged for his life. As the demon laughed and shook its ugly head, a thought came to Lucian, and he quickly begged for one last meal.<br><br>The demon stepped back, smiled, and said he would entertain his last request. He told him he would allow him to live for as much time it would take for him to fill his belly with whatever he could find on this battlefield\u2026 no\u2026 not battlefield\u2026 buffet\u2026 this buffet of death.<br><br>Lucian didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to eat. He wasn't a cannibal, and he certainly didn't want to commit any kind of sin before dying. He was about to surrender to his fate when he felt something squirm by his hand. He looked down and that's when he saw the\u2026 tiny, awful things\u2026 squirming out of the bloated belly of a corpse\u2026 falling on his hand.<br><br>Desperate, Lucian did the unthinkable. With a miserable sigh, he plunged his hand into the rotting belly, felt around the stinking, oozing innards and soon pulled out a dangling white maggot.<br><br>Swallowing a thickness in his throat, he held the tiny, awful thing up in the moonlight, then opened his mouth and let the maggot plop onto his tongue. The demon winced in disgust, laughed in disbelief, then said some words in a strange, unknown language.<br><br>Lucian didn't understand any of it, but he thought he might have been cursed as he strangely began to feel a great insatiable hunger for maggots. More than this, he even began savoring them as one might savor a fine wine or coffee, enjoying, to his disbelief, the aftertaste.<br><br>I guess we can say that as a coffee bean soaks up the essence of the tree and land it grows upon, a maggot soaks up the essence of the corpse it feeds upon.<br><br>The demon smiled at Lucian as he desperately tried to delay the inevitable. When Lucian finally finished savoring the maggot, the demon told him his time was up.<br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been crushed by a club. Blood and gore spilled out of the eye sockets like spaghetti and meatballs. And there in the spaghetti and meatballs tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his greedy, salivating, tongue.<br><br>Robust. Earthy. Slimy. A velvety maggot that bursts with herbal notes and soothes with its fresh and bold character.<br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up.<br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been diced into small pieces by an ax. Chunks of bone and intestine festered in pools of blood like stew. And there in the stew tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue.<br><br>Bold, yet fruity. Chewy. A sweet maggot with delicate hints of citrus.<br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up.<br><br>Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been trampled by horses and marching soldiers. Pieces of skull and brain fermented in bile and blood like a delicious dipping sauce for veggies. And there in the dipping sauce tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue.<br><br>Herbal. Intense. Mushy. A full-bodied maggot rich in flavor.<br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up\u2026and as you can imagine the story goes on and on cause the demon enjoyed watching this coward grovel like a maggot for his life. And since it goes on and on, I would appreciate some help telling it\u2026 at least until we run out of tiny, awful things.<br><br>Please pass this bowl of putrid guts and gore around the Moonstone. I invite you to reach inside and choose a tiny, awful thing to savor.<br><br>Please feel free to describe its flavors and let's not spare any gory, juicy, mushy details.<br><br>Okay, okay. I confess\u2026 They aren't real maggots, but slimy, sugary things soaking in warm brandy and pumpkin guts\u2026 but let's stick our hands in anyway and have a little fun to help us get into the spirit of Halloween.",

I can tell you where the coffee comes from, but please don't ask me where the stories and characters come from cause I basically have no clue. Some say it's the aroma of freshly brewed coffee that inspires me. Others say I'm able to tap into the endless memory streams pouring out of the infinite kettle that is the multiverse. I think it's a little bit of both. This one comes from the grains I observed at the bottom of my espresso cup a few days ago. It kind of resembled a bell\u2026 and so I'm calling this one\u2026 The Bell from Hell.<br><br>Toby and his sister Tina were always up to no good, and this time they snuck into the old, overgrown junkyard that many claimed was haunted. Despite the rumors, the teens played in the rusty wrecks, honking horns, kicking windshields, and, of course, scaring each other to hell.<br><br>'It's fun here!'' Toby said.<br><br>'It is!'' Tina agreed.<br><br>As the night wore on Toby hid in the trunk of an old sedan with the intention of scaring his sister. But Tina followed a trail he unwittingly left and\u2014<br><br>RRRAAH!<br><br>Scared him instead!<br><br>Toby cursed, and Tina ran off promising she would get him, again. She quickly rushed to the old compactor and hid in a half-squashed station wagon filled with a strange, black fog. That's odd, she thought, and didn't think any more of it.<br><br>But she probably should have thought a little more of it since strange, black fog isn't exactly an omen as you know from my previous stories. Anyhow, Tina waited patiently in the backseat. When an hour passed, she began to worry. Slowly, she craned her head to peak out the window when\u2014<br><br>RRRAAH!<br><br>Toby slammed the station!<br><br>Tina nearly jumped out of her skin, hitting her head against the ceiling of the half-crumpled car. Toby couldn't help but laugh, and as he laughed, he looked down into the churning, black fog and saw\u2014<br><br>A bell.<br><br>A strange-looking, iron bell unlike any bell he had ever seen before.<br><br>''Will you look at this, '' he said, holding up the bell, examining the craftsmanship. Then he grabbed a stick from the ground and clanged the bell stupidly.<br><br>CLANG. CLANG. CLANG.<br><br>The ominous ring echoed through the abandoned junkyard as the black fog thickened and swirled around them. But before they could say anything about the strange fog\u2014<br><br>The compactor came to life!<br><br>WHIRRRRRR!<br><br>Tina felt her heart fall into the pit of her stomach, and she screamed in horror!<br><br>Toby dropped the bell, grabbed her hands and yanked her out just in time. Breathlessly, they watched the station wagon as it creaked and groaned and shattered into scrap.<br><br>There was a long, tense silence as they wondered what had given sudden power to the otherwise rusted and broken compactor. Just then, the bell rang, again. This time behind them. Tina exchanged a look with Toby and swallowed a growing thickness in her throat. They turned slowly to face\u2014<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Absolutely, nothing.<br><br>Nothing but the swirling fog.<br><br>It was probably just their imaginations.<br><br>Or was it\u2026<br><br>For just as they released a collective sigh, the bell rang once again, and something suddenly materialized out of the fog. Within moments, they were face to face with a\u2014<br><br>Wraith!<br><br>The Wraith instantly grabbed Toby by the neck with one arm and lifted him high in the silvery moonlight, his feet dangling, his arms flailing, his lips quivering with fear.<br><br>Tina gasped and stumbled back to her haunches. The Wraith smashed Toby against the ground with a powerful thud. He raised a rusted, wheel wrench and proceeded to bludgeon his head to scrap, blood and gore splattering everywhere.<br><br>Then the Wraith turned to face Tina with his creepy bell and dead eyes. Covered in her brother's warm blood, Tina screamed until her lungs gave out and waited\u2026 for the bell to toll.<br><br>Now what the siblings didn't realize was that they had entered a kind of dimensional pocket that had brought them to another world. See, there are these pockets or holes in the world that lead to all kinds of dark places\u2026 places that defy reality\u2026 dark places that make all our combined depictions of hell seem like a flower garden. But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just say that for Toby and Tina death was not an escape.",

                        "text": "<b>Stories from the Witch Caf\u00e9. Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone Caf\u00e9! Tonight, seeing as we just made a batch of Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake to go with our famous Halloween Latte, I thought a story about pumpkins might be fitting. This story was told long ago in a village that once stood very close to where we all stand now, and I call this one, Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.<br><br>The widow's name was Ulla and more than anything she wanted to win the annual pumpkin festival. Not just for the prize money, but to impress her six-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who loved everything about pumpkins. Their texture. Their shape. Their color. Their smell. Everything.<br><br>But Ulla's pumpkins were nothing compared to her neighbor's pumpkins. Her neighbor Mona won the pumpkin festival every year, and she seemed to have a secret for growing perfect pumpkins.<br><br>That's not to say, Ulla's pumpkins were bad. They weren't. They just weren't very special. At best, they had been described by the great pumpkin judges as average. Average height. Average width. Average color. Average smell. Average. And average didn't win awards.<br><br>Well, not wanting to be average anymore, Ulla decided she needed to know Mona's secret. So, one morning she waited until Mona left for the market, and when she knew the coast was clear, she did the unthinkable. She snuck into her house.<br><br>To Ulla's amazement the kitchen was filled with glass jars containing pumpkin seeds of every variety. Each jar had a label that included a name, instructions, and some very peculiar symbols. Reading the labels, Ulla felt a cold shiver run through her body. She couldn't make sense of the names or symbols and for a moment, just a moment, she suspected witchcraft.<br><br>Part of her wanted to run, but the other part\u2014the part that hated to lose\u2014wanted a little help, a little boost, a fighting chance to win the festival and make her daughter proud.<br><br>Ignoring her better instinct to run, Ulla found a jar labeled: Mortafykuss Cucurruss. She scrutinized the label and read that these seeds would produce the biggest and brightest pumpkins but that they were still quite unstable. The seeds were unstable. Ulla winced, and she had no idea what that meant or how pumpkin seeds could be unstable. She continued to read a warning\u2014<br><br>No blood. Especially at night.<br><br>She laughed out loud. Who in their right mind would feed a plant blood? Who would heed such a warning? And for a moment she really thought that maybe, just maybe, Mona was a witch, a powerful witch who could defy nature and modify and mutate seeds.<br><br>Despite the creepy warnings, Ulla borrowed one seed--just one-- from the Mortafykuss Cucurruss jar, convincing herself that she would give Mona back a seed from her winning pumpkin. With that promise, she convinced herself she wasn't stealing, and she quickly returned to her small, humble farm.<br><br>No sooner did Ulla return home than she planted the seed in her garden. To her amazement there was a visible pumpkin growing the very next day, and every day after that more pumpkins appeared linked to a thorny, green vine unlike anything she had ever seen before.<br><br>Well, to be sure, Rebecca jumped up and down with joy at the sight of the massive pumpkins. She couldn't stop hugging and measuring and sniffing the pumpkins.<br><br>When the time came, Ulla told Rebecca to choose a pumpkin for the festival, and as she selected the choicest pumpkin from the patch, she got so excited that she tumbled into the thick, green vines and cut herself against the thorns. The vines and pumpkins trembled momentarily with sudden life.<br><br>Ulla dismissed the sudden movement as the wind and proceeded to dress her daughter's wounds. Then she placed the chosen pumpkin on a wheelbarrow and pushed it to the market to face the judges of the great, big pumpkin festival.<br><br>It didn't take long to declare Ulla the winner. And Rebecca jumped up and down, and she screamed and celebrated that they had finally won the festival.<br><br>Ulla reveled in her daughter's joy and felt a great surge of pride.<br><br>But that joy was short-lived when Mona suddenly emerged from the crowd admiring the winning pumpkin and sniffing it as though searching for a signature scent. A tell-tale. Proof that Ulla had stolen one of her seeds. Then she put her ear to the pumpkin and locked eyes with Ulla. For a moment, it seemed as though she wanted to say something. But then, Mona smiled, gave the pumpkin a gentle caress, and walked away.<br><br>Ulla watched Mona until she disappeared, and she told herself she would gut her winning pumpkin and return a seed back to Mona just as soon as she returned home.<br><br>And so, with exhausted arms, Ulla wheelbarrowed her pumpkin down the dirt road with her daughter singing and skipping behind her in the moonlight. Caught up in the euphoria of winning, Ulla tried to skip with her daughter, but she missed a beat and twisted her foot on a stone.<br><br>Ulla stumbled forward, lost control of the wheelbarrow and the great, big pumpkin tumbled out, smashing against a massive stone.<br><br>Suddenly, mother and daughter froze in terror!<br><br>Thick, orange liquid like blood poured out of the busted pumpkin. Through the cracks they could see something moving\u2026 something\u2026 breathing\u2026<br><br>Ulla approached the pumpkin slowly. She hesitated, then placed her fingers in the pulpy crack and pulled and pulled and\u2014<br><br>WHAAAAH!<br><br>A pumpkin baby burst out!<br><br>And attached itself to her face!<br><br>Pulp dripping down her face and back, Ulla ripped the pumpkin baby off her face and smashed it repeatedly against the ground as it wailed and screamed and finally died. Then she dropped the limp, pulpy corpse in the grass and watched it melt into a thick, orange puddle of steaming, pumpkin puss.<br><br>Ulla grabbed her daughter by the hand and rushed home. But when they reached home\u2026 the whole farm had been overrun by gigantic, bright orange pumpkins and thick vines with thorns like knives.<br><br>Wanting to burn the pumpkin patch down, Ulla held her daughter close, and she led her to the shed as the vines trembled, slithered and brushed by their feet. Then, all at once, the vines coiled around their ankles and\u2014<br><br>WHAAAAP!<br><br>Mother and daughter hit the ground as throbbing vines wrapped around them like hungry snakes.<br><br>Ulla stared in horror as massive pumpkins seemed to suddenly hatch like giant orange eggs in the moonlight. From those pumpkins came creatures staggering on two legs with long, clumsy vines for arms.<br><br>And as these killer pumpkins closed in on Ulla, she noticed they had orange and green skin and thick thorns for feet, and\u2026 the faces\u2026 they\u2026 resembled\u2026 her daughter.<br><br>Before she could make sense of what she was seeing, an evil vine coiled around her neck and head and thirsty thorns pierced her skin and gorged on her blood as hundreds of newborn pumpkin monsters wailed at the moon and a cold darkness swept over her.<br><br>As for the younglings\u2026 they grew and multiplied and went on a murderous rampage throughout the town. But, rest assured, they were finally stopped by a few good witches with some pretty powerful spells. But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just agree that we shouldn't mess around with pumpkin seeds and that we prefer to eat our pumpkins than be eaten by them.",

A few of us found more of these scrolls and strange instruments like the glowing blue contraption in the basement. The symbols on the scrolls seem very familiar to those found within the pages of Sam Park\u2019s codex. Several of these ancient scrolls were returned to the House of Arkham, and upon further inspection, it was clear that the scrolls were made out of human skin and that someone had been hunting people with arcane symbols tattooed on their bodies. Strange yet fascinating to think that there are human \u2018books\u2019 walking around the realm with secret knowledge that could possibly help us better understand this loveless inferno. Could make for an interesting character in the moving picture I will eventually write, produce and direct. I imagine a character recording the secrets of the universe on his skin with cosmic ink that cannot be erased, smudged, or destroyed. But, in reality, he\u2019s probably some ordinary Joe from a strange world who tattooed a grocery list on his body. Curious to learn more about these \u2018human books,\u2019 I spent time researching the Chamber of Blood for stories inspired by or referencing a character like him. No luck yet, though I did find one story about strange instruments attached to hooks and generators that could open a portal out of a hellish world not unlike this one.

First, the fog is rich in Auric particles leading me to believe this dimension is more conscious than it is material. Second, I should be able to manifest anything I am able to pull from rifts in the fog using techniques passed down from my family. Third\u2026 The Entity is far more ancient than we ever suspected back home and most of our theories and conjectures were wrong.

He points at his fan shirt and extends a thumbs-up for a great title defense, but she looks past him as she nurses a beer. Wallace sees Mika and nudges Ace. She could kick your ass in two licks. Ace scoffs. That\u2019s a bet you would lose, asshole. I\u2019m double her size and strength. Wallace snickers. I say you don\u2019t last ten minutes\u2026 nah\u2026 you don\u2019t even last five minutes. Wallace is talking shit just to talk shit. Before Ace can respond, a bell sounds and everyone goes silent as the idiot lifts the bowl of thick, moist slugs to his trembling lips. Ace stops breathing, narrows his gaze, pulls out his lucky alligator tooth, holds it in his fist, and just knows he\u2019s got a winner. In a few short minutes he\u2019ll be laughing all the way to the bank. Come on, idiot\u2026swallow those slugs.",

She holds her lucky piece of tire in her hand though she doesn\u2019t really believe in luck. She hears her mom\u2019s voice rattle in her brain. The only luck you get is the luck you make. And yet\u2026 the piece of tire kind of looks like a horseshoe. Coincidence? Probably. She admires her lucky slice of tire and starts when she hears a twig snap behind her. Before she realizes what\u2019s happening, she\u2019s thrust to the ground by a shadowy figure who stomps on her ankle. Terrible pain shoots up her spine and she screams for help as the shadow bolts away. Meg screams in agony as she desperately scrambles to her feet. As soon as her wounded foot touches the ground another sharp pain rushes through her like wildfire and she collapses. She closes her eyes, gathers herself, suppresses her pain and reaches around for something, anything, to support her weight. A moment later she grabs a thick, gnarled, branch and shrieks as she forces herself to stand. Every step home is like a hammer smashing at her ankle.",

Listening to The Storyteller and hearing familiar expressions I am wondering: how do I keep myself out of my own creations? The memories I attempt to record as fast as I experience them prove one thing to me. They show me objectivity is impossible, or elusive at best, and I\u2019m never quite sure if my logs are a true and accurate depiction of the subject\u2019s memory or a whiskey laden interpretation of a nightmare. To add to my frustrations, I have recently noticed other voices have made their way into my notes. Other interpretations.

He puts his ear to the door and hears a laugh, a deep guttural laugh. He feels his skin crawl and his stomach twist in knots. It can only be Chief. He hates Chief especially when he's with his Pa. They make him do all kinds of things for fun and laughs. His Pa brags about his killing tool as he often calls him. More laughter. Other voices. Chief brought some deputies to enjoy the show. He wants to smash them all to bits just to make them stop laughing. Everyone laughs at him. The whole world laughs at him. He grinds his teeth with frustration. They ain't supposed to laugh. They're supposed to protect him and he knows it. He's seen it on his TV, the only thing that calms him and keeps him company when he's done his work. TV is something special\u2026 the friend and parent he never had\u2026 But Chief\u2026 Chief ain't like those on TV. He's another kind of Chief of police. The kind that works with Pa to clean money. He doesn't even know what that means but he overheard them by the pigpen talking about cleaning a whole load of money and sharing that load with a judge and other men of the law. They clean money together. That's why Chief lets Pa and Ma do whatever they want to him. Chief is crooked his Pa always says. Crooked like his boy's face. The laughter grows louder. They approach his brick dungeon and he shivers at the thought of more slaughter. He's tired of killing to make a few deputies laugh. Real tired. He feels his blood boiling, feels it rising through his neck, feels it pushing up his face like it wants to burst through his skull. A sudden high-pitching whistling noise fills his ears. He hits his head over and over again until the whining stops. Silence returns, for a moment, just a moment, and then a chain rattles. Bolts snap loudly as he loses balance and falls back to his haunches. The door opens filling his brick cell with blinding sunlight. He covers his eyes with his arm. His Pa steps inside, grabs him, and yanks him to his feet. Come on, Boy! Let's show these deputies your worth!",

More like\u2026 like he's living on a TV show\u2026 watching himself from a distance. Slaughtered cows thick and wet all around him. Seven or eight of them writhing helplessly in warm, coagulating blood. Heads cracked open. Brain and gore spilling out. Flies buzzing around him, buzzing in his face, buzzing in his ears, telling him this slaughter is who he is. This senseless slaughter is his worth\u2026 his only worth. Kill. That's what they love to watch you do. Kill. Kill. Kill. The flies are laughing at him. Laughing with Chief and his deputies. Telling him he's so useless he don't even have a name. Boy! What kind of name is that! His Pa shoves him toward another cow. You ain't done yet! Boy raises his hammer and shakes blood from his eyes. He feels strange. Weird. Unhinged. Fed up. He's had enough of this life. The cell. Shoveling manure. Slaughter. Endless slaughter. And taking care of those pigs. Those prized pigs\u2014pigs given more love by his parents than he ever got. The flies circle his face and laugh at him. The high-pitch whining returns. The pigs got names and you didn't! Duke and Donny. He swats at the flies. Pa nudges him. Come on, Boy, show'em you can do more with that hammer! Boy\u2026 That's what Pa calls him. Boy\u2026 That's what Ma calls him. They think he's too dumb to know he doesn't have a name. A real name. He knows. All his life he knew. He knew and imagined himself as Max\u2026 Max Thomson. Imagined his Pa was so proud of him that he gave him his name. How he dreamed to have his father's name\u2026 how he dreamed\u2026 Pa shoves him. Come on! Show'em! Show'em now! Boy feels his face fill with blood. His veins swell with fury. His temples throb maddeningly. The next moments are a blur. Blood and screams everywhere! Not bovine\u2026 human\u2026 the whining begins again and he's confused, searching for his Pa but not finding him. The whining stops and everything is muffled. He turns to see Chief charging him. What have you done!? Boy doesn't really hear him. It's like when Ma held his head in a bucket of water to teach him not to call or cry for her when he was a child. Everything's muffled, distorted, surreal. Chief tackles him and grabs the gory hammer out of his hand. You killed'em! Your Pa! Jim! Don! Ray! My men! My fuckin men! Boy pushes Chief off and tumbles out of the barn, drenched in blood, heading toward the main house, screaming for his Ma in the growing dusk.",

Words he only understands. Words the TV taught him. He wants to know his name, his real name, and she just stares at him, confused, lost, desperate. She gurgles blood and chips of tooth slip down the side of her face as she begs for her life. Even if she understood what he was saying she could tell him nothing. My name! My name! What's my name! Boy slams his Ma against the ground again and again. He lifts her over his head and hurtles her against the kitchen table. It breaks under her weight. Blood gushes from a wound in her leg. She loses consciousness. He feels bad and holds his limp body. Why? Why did you hate me? What did I do to make you both hate me so much? Her face is beautiful and hideous at the same time. Evil veiled by beauty. He hugs her, harder and harder, wishing everything would have been different, wishing he were one of those damn pigs. They spoiled them with love, affection and time\u2014all that time they spent Duke and Donny while he groveled nameless and alone in a dungeon built just for him. He tries to lift her but slips in a pool of her blood. She struggles in his embrace. Every time he asks the question he squeezes her tighter and tighter. My name\u2026 What's my name? Her struggles cease and she jerks spasmodically. Tense arms and legs go limp. He releases her slowly. Her head thumps hard in a puddle of blood. She stares upward with blue vacant eyes. Beautiful blue vacant eyes. Eyes that only saw a monster, a thing, a beast of burden to work the farm. Never a son. Never her son. He hates those eyes. Those\u2026those\u2026 hateful eyes. He rips them out and squeezes. They pop like bovine eyes. He smiles and doesn't really know why he's smiling. He wipes blood off his face and likes the mushy feeling in his hands. He hears a foot pound the floor behind him. Chief suddenly rushes into the kitchen. I'm gonna smash your head with your own goddamn hammer! But as he lifts the hammer he slips in an inch of warm blood. Boy panics and rushes outside into the darkening woods with Chief screaming and cursing and bullets whipping by him.",

Things Boy doesn't want to hear. Your parents tried to kill you. Let a pot of boiling water spill over you, and told us you were a clumsy child. They says you pulled the pot down from the stove, but I knew better. I seen right through'em. Too embarrassed of their deformed kid that they poured scalding water over him. Tried to kill you! Tried to make it look like an accident. Boy covers his ears. Flies buzz about, laughing. He doesn't want to hear this. A high pitch ringing echoes though his mind. Stop! Stop! Stop! But it won't stop. He knows he's the only one who can hear the whining and laughing flies. He knows he hears things. He knows his Pa hurt him. Hurt his head. Screamed too loud in his ear when he was a baby. Screamed mean things. Mean things like he wished Ma's belly-cord strangled him completely and not just halfway. He takes a moment to gather himself.

For a moment he stares at him as though seeing something more than a tool or a freak show. Something smarter than a mule. Smarter and deadlier. The deputy seems lost and confused\u2026 like a mindless zombie on TV. The trembling, confused deputy shuffles forward feeling his wet mushy head. Boy moves to the side to let him pass and stares at his good work. Stares at the gore dripping from his skull like putty. Watches him stagger left and right in the moonlight. If he were a cow, he'd end his suffering. But he's not a cow. He's something else. Something vile and corrupt. Boy watches him disappear in the shadows.

It's got the same texture as cow brain. He probably couldn't tell the difference if he had a lump in each hand. He squeezes and likes the feeling. It soothes him, calms him, relieves his anxiety. His thoughts wander to his favorite TV shows. Ma and Pa let him have a TV to shut him up. They got tired of him smashing the wall and crying for them. Nothing worked. Not the gag or the rope that he always managed to get out of. Only the TV. TV was better than any constraint. It kept him sitting down, passive, complacent and quiet. Ma said it hypnotized him and that was a good thing. The TV showed Boy so many things. Showed him how different his life was from other children. Showed him what parents should have been like. He wishes his parents were more like Clark's parents. They made a hero out of their son just by being good to him and raising him right. They took good care of him and he wasn't even theirs. Or\u2026 the other parents\u2026 the parents of that other boy, Beaver. He had a good family. But he wasn't like them. He wasn't like Clark or Beaver. He came into the world hurt, deformed and weak like a runt. His Pa told him he had wanted to stuff him in a bag with rocks and throw him in the lake. Tough love. Tough life. Tough everything.

He closes his eyes and thinks of Clark and waits for the greatest of all heroes to save him. He never comes and it's not like TV. He's always there to save the day. He's always there to help those who need help. But TV ain't reality and he's alone. He's alone because he was born a crooked little beast. Boy opens his eyes and stares at the gory lump in his hand.

I can't remember which one of us figured how to do it\u2026 but we realized that the stories were codes to pass on coordinates of locations of interest for some group or cult or whatever. We decoded a few other stories and came to the conclusion that these people were sending encrypted locations of places where they believe there would be ghosts. We didn't buy any of that paranormal crap and we were just having fun drinking and decoding the stories and looking up the places on satellite maps. But when the coordinates of one story turned out to be close to us, we thought we could check out the place for fun. Adrien rented a car and we headed up to what was left of the crumbling asylum. There was nothing but overgrown ruins. But I remember this unnatural black fog and it was like we were at the asylum but some other version of it. It was really strange. And that's when we saw this thing\u2026 this giant samurai with a demon mask lurking about as though it had stepped out of one world and into another. He killed Mia first. I don't remember what happened exactly\u2026 I just saw\u2026 I saw her head thump and tumble across the ground. I don't remember much\u2026 I remember crawling out of the fog and that demon or apparition or whatever that thing was couldn't follow me\u2026 like it was blocked by something invisible. Not long after a man who called himself Hans and who identified himself as a detective arrived and asked me questions about what I had seen. He took some notes and seemed a bit strange. Then when he heard the sirens approaching, he disappeared just like that. When the police arrived, the fog was gone leaving only the\u2026 the\u2026 hacked remains of my friends.

She turned in the gathering dust and instinctively felt the attack before it came as she often did. With one quick thrust of her arm, the blade of the kukri severed the hand. The creature shrieked something terrible.<br><br>Haddie seized the opportunity to severe the head but the creature lunged away and the blade hit the stone wall. The kukri vibrated out of her hand and she dove to the ground as the creature charged her.<br><br>Tumbling away, Haddie instinctively grabbed a slab of stone. The creature attacked and missed, hitting the wall. Without hesitation Haddie smashed the slab over its bewildered head with a terrible crunching sound she wouldn't soon forget.<br><br>The creature collapsed and Haddie, adrenalin rushing, bludgeoned the head and eyes. When there was nothing left but a sticky, warm pulp she released the gore-covered stone and fell back on her haunches to gather herself. But no sooner did she relax than she heard the rising crescendo of chattering teeth echoing through the darkness.<br><br>With an almost defeated sigh, Haddie staggered to her feet. White fear flashed through her mind as the chattering and hissing grew louder and louder. Teeth clenched as thousands of red eyes flared up in the inky blackness of the cave. She backed away slowly, then spun on her heals and ran!",

In her mind's eye she saw cloaked figures hiding pieces of the same pillar in another world. She shrugged and kept what she had seen to herself. Then she pulled out her cellphone and handed it to Jordan. He centered her in the frame and indicated he was filming.<br><br>Haddie cleared her throat, mopped her forehead of sweat and soot, looked into the lens, and proceeded to address her online followers:<br><br>\u201cMy name is Haddie and I was born with a wonderful curse. All my life I've attracted strange and unusual things, and when I was twelve, I realized I was able to acquire insight to unexplainable events and otherworldly places.\u201d<br><br>She took a moment to calm her racing heart. She swallowed her fear, remembered she had a series to sell, and forced energy and pep into her voice. \u201cWhat do you need to know about India? It's where my father grew up and it's where I am today to explore the urban legends of this amazing country.\u201d<br><br>Haddie took a moment to find her words.<br><br>\u201cOur adventure begins in Northern India at a strange place locals call The Eyes or the Valley of Evil Eyes where hundreds have disappeared or died including a unit of British soldiers in the 1800s. What happened to these soldiers? Where did they disappear to? And is there any merit to the accounts of a cave-dwelling demon with eyes around its head that burn right through the soul?\u201d<br><br>Haddie stared meditatively into the camera and wanted to say 'yes' to every one of her questions but decided it was better to leave them up to interpretation. After a dramatic pause, she finished, \u201cTake a look at what we discovered. Judge the evidence for yourself\u2026 and see if there is any truth to the Evil Eyes of the Himalayas.\u201d",

She yells helplessly and the dead, smoldering riders begin to evaporate into a column of light breaking through the darkness. A rider suddenly stands in front of her. She skids, loses control, and tumbles over the road. Her insides feel like mush. Things are broken everywhere. Cracked bones rip through her skin, spitting out black, warm fluid.

An infected suddenly charges Zoey. Francis clubs its head off. Merry Christmas! He looks to Bill for a reaction. Bill shakes his head and seems unimpressed. Find your own line, kid, if you've got the grey matter to do so. Francis scoffs. Louis adjusts his tie. Francis makes a face and nudges Louis. Lose the tie\u2026 Lose the god damn tie. Louis ignores him. Zoey motions for the boys to shut the hell up and follow her. Let's find an Island where we can rot on and then fight over ties. Bill raises an inspired eyebrow. That sounds like a plan. He actually likes the idea of rotting an island while the world goes to hell. Kid's right! Grab some gear and let's get outta here!",

So much to read\u2026 and yet I find myself drawn to the scribblings and renditions of the unknown creator I'm calling the Mad Designer. Journals filled with the wild sketches and musings of people I imagine are caught in other parts of this living dimension--people juxtaposed with other Terra worlds and timelines that make little or no sense to who they are or where they come from. The illustrations and notes are foolish, absurd and quite contradictory, and yet they bring moments of levity to my life which does the soul good. I suppose it's a form of absurd escapism I turn to when I'm not reading the more traditional stories. Interestingly enough, I found seventeen versions of a story featuring a killer named Evan written by seventeen versions of the same author from the omniverse. Seventeen similar stories with sometimes subtle, sometimes significant differences. What I find particularly interesting is how the stories are written as fiction in one world and non-fiction in another. It reminds me of Universus Alveo\u2026 a theory that suggests that the human mind might very well be equipped with a powerful networking mechanism that reaches out to other worlds for wisdom and knowledge from our other-selves. Some can use their minds in this way and others can't. The theory suggests that those who have experienced trauma in their formative years detach from their reality, allowing them to explore other realities and worlds with relative ease. Artists like magicians and shamans see small things in the big, unexplainable endless dream that is the omniverse and they bring these ideas or insights back to entertain, enlighten and inspire the world. Fiction in one world, non-fiction in another. Everything is real, or nothing is. And here in the Chamber of Blood there are countless horror stories of every variety. So many that it seems to me that one of the unknown prisoners was collecting these stories as a way to discover more about their imprisonment, the Entity and the terrible screams coming from the surrounding abyss. Whether this true or not, I'm not sure, but what I do know is I spent the whole night reading my favorite stories out loud like my father used to do by the fireplace. And the entire time I couldn't help but wonder\u2026 How? How could anyone have accessed and assembled such a rich collection of notes, journals and stories? I have no immediate answer, but I suspect by the texture and density of the fog that I may be in a place as complex, mysterious and misunderstood as a black hole\u2014a living, breathing, all-consuming black hole, the serpent of infinity that gorges on its tail, that eats itself endlessly as it spirals downward into the cosmic, Fibonacci stew that is life incomprehensible.",

He read the opening lines and decided they could be stronger. With a sigh, he tore the yellow page from the legal pad, crumpled it into a ball and tossed it into a growing pile of false-starts in the middle of the opulent, black and burgundy hotel room. He slammed the desk, frustrated, and wanted to write something fun and original for his blog, yet nothing came to him. The latest episode sponsored by their mysterious benefactor had his production team investigate ancient tombs in South-West, Turkey. Not so much him. But his niece and nephew, who had tougher nerves for the macabre.<br><br>Stefan much preferred a safe and cozy hotel room where he could raid the mini-bar and see to the logistics of the show. It wasn't that he didn't like adventure. It was more that he didn't like graves, tombs or places that felt dark, creepy and dangerous. Haddie had once suggested that he wrote horror stories as a kind of therapy to work out his fears and anxieties of the unknown. She was half right. The other half was that he simply liked to be alone\u2014alone with all the characters and voices chattering in his head, voices that demanded to be heard and set to paper.<br><br>Now the voices were compelling him to write a vampire story. Their benefactor claimed that there had been a village of real vampires in ancient Anatolia that had been hidden from the rest of the world. According to the intelligence provided, vampires weren't fictional monsters but actual intra-dimensional creatures that had once tried to overrun the world. They had been defeated by an unknown group of mystical warriors. Somehow the few creatures that had survived managed to erase themselves from history by warping and weaving whatever memory of them was left into exaggerated myths and legends.<br><br>Stefan found this theory of myths and legends and parallel worlds interesting if not intriguing.<br><br>Vampires real.<br><br>Actually, real.<br><br>Nothing like the movies, but real nevertheless.<br><br>One theory he had just finished reading online suggested that everything created or imagined existed somewhere in the 'Garden of Infinity.' In other words, stories and characters came from a real place in the infinite landscape that was the omniverse.<br><br>The theory went on to suggest that artists had somehow unlocked their third eye and were able to see into other realities. An idea, a vision, or a dream, according to the theory, was the pineal gland seeing into the infinite for truth, wisdom, inspiration. The brain, then, was a quantum computer that could network with the infinite. It was a nice idea. It meant that his most cherished characters from his favorite books\u2026 were somehow\u2026 somewhere\u2026 real. A sudden knock at the door startled him out of his quantum musings.<br><br>\"Mr. Roi\u2026 Your lunch is ready.\"<br><br>Lunchtime already and Stefan still didn't have his story.

Haddie dropped her shovel, sighed, exchange a look with her brother and stepped away from the bolted casket.<br><br>\"Who do you work for?\" Haddie asked, eying the woman.<br><br>\"That, my dear, does not concern you.\"<br><br>Jordan shook his head. \"I don't think you should open it.\"<br><br>\"Shut-up!\"<br><br>\"My brother's right.\" Haddie pointed at the symbols etched all in the rotten wood of the casket. \"It's a warning of some kind\u2026 whatever's in there\u2026 is meant to stay in there.\" She scrutinized the half-crescent and three dots and wondered what they meant. They didn't resemble any of the other symbols she had come across in the last few months.<br><br>\"Superstitious nonsense!\" The woman yelled, aimed the revolver at the bolt and pulled the trigger. A report echoed through the ruins and the surrounding forest.<br><br>Haddie wondered if their guide and translator had heard them. He probably didn't even take notice or didn't care. He refused to follow them near the tombs, called them ignorant tourists, and said he would stay by the car texting his friends until they returned. The woman pulled the trigger repeatedly until the bolt clanged off and hit the ground with a thud.<br><br>\"I hope he calls the police,\" Jordan whispered to Haddie.<br><br>\"I wouldn't count on it\u2026\"<br><br>The woman examined the casket carefully. Haddie and Jordan inched backward as she struggled to yank the lid open. As Haddie cautiously backed away, she figured the woman worked for the same secret society that had now interfered with several of her investigations.<br><br>She didn't know much about them, but from what she had gathered by overhearing a few of their goons in Egypt was that they were searching for hidden knowledge\u2014knowledge they believed would help humanity transcend to another plane of existence.<br><br>\"Please\u2026\" Haddie cautioned. \"Don't open it until we know what the symbol means.\"<br><br>The goon scoffed and, with a labored scream, yanked the lid open to reveal\u2014<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Nothing but a strange black mist.<br><br>\"I don't understand,\" she said. \"It's supposed to be here\u2026 the book\u2026\"<br><br>The goon's eyes narrowed. Frustration creased her face as black mist suddenly rose and spiralled into her mouth and nose as though it were alive.<br><br>Haddie and Jordan stepped out of the grave.<br><br>The woman gagged, coughed and collapsed. There in the dirt, she jerked and twitched in all kinds of unnatural directions, screaming and shrieking as the mist reshaped her body into something indescribably grotesque. Her veins stood out thick and black in her neck. Her hands smashed the ground, and she went into hysteric convulsions as though being burned alive. Then, with a blood-curdling scream, her body went limp and silent.<br><br>Haddie repressed a cry of horror. She felt a cold prickle run down her spine as she stared at the scene in disbelief. What was going on? What strange mist could do such a thing to a person? Was it some kind of ancient poison\u2026 some kind of toxic vapor\u2026 or was it something worse\u2026<br><br>\"Well\u2026 you don't see that every day, do you?\" Jordan said flatly. \"I seriously wish I got that on my phone.\"<br><br>Haddie sighed. \"Is she dead?\"<br><br>\"Dead as a tomb.\"<br><br>Haddie didn't find him funny. Not in the least. He was scared. She could tell by his desperate attempt to use humor to hide his fear. He was just about to crack another joke when the creature suddenly twitched back to life.<br><br>Startled, Haddie gasped and pulled at Jordan's t-shirt, saying, \"We need to get out of here.\" But just as she stepped back, the creature turned to face them with blood-red eyes and a jaw protruding like a snout with teeth that seemed to be growing underneath stretched skin.<br><br>\"Oh shit!\" Haddie blurted. She lost her footing, and fell to the ground with her brother. The creature that had once been a woman roared at them, revealing two massive fangs like carving knives.",

Spotting an outcrop of jagged rocks, she quickly yanked her brother into hiding.<br><br>\"Aren't vampires supposed to explode in sunlight?\" Jordan asked. \"I mean, isn't that what's supposed to happen!? Doesn't it know it's supposed to be dead?\"<br><br>Haddie instantly placed a finger by his quivering lips as she heard footfalls approaching. She repressed an urge to look at the creature. Instead, she listened. She could hear the clattering and hissing coming from its hungry jaws. She could hear the crunch of stones and the distinct snap of twigs as the creature searched for them. Then the footfalls seemed to change direction, growing fainter and fainter until all she heard was the chirping of insects.<br><br>Haddie heaved a shuddering breath.<br><br>Jordan gulped and swallowed a lump in his throat, saying, \"We should have respected the warning.\"<br><br>\"If that's what it was\u2026 a warning\u2026\"<br><br>\"What else could it be?\"<br><br>\"I don't know\u2026 What I do know is\u2026 we've released something foul into the world.\"<br><br>\"And by foul you mean the vampire and not gas,\" Jordan said with a smirk. \"Just clarifying.\"<br><br>\"Not funny.\"<br><br>\"A little funny.\"<br><br>\"No. Not even a little.\"<br><br>Haddie risked moving beyond the rocks. She glanced apprehensively, half expecting the creature to hurl itself at them. When nothing happened, she stood and, slowly and quietly, led Jordan back toward their guide.<br><br>As she pushed her way through the woods, she couldn't help but notice the similarities between all the symbols she had seen at the last few investigation sites. They were unlike anything she had ever seen before and she had discovered them in completely different parts of the world. India. Africa. Portugal. England. Paris. And now\u2026 Turkey.<br><br>Haddie couldn't help but feel something was amiss. She broke the silence, saying, \"We're being pulled into something far more complex than we've been led to believe. Almost like\u2026 we're being used\u2026\"<br><br>\"Used? For what? Who cares about a bunch of bozos from Montreal who release foul things into the world?\"<br><br>Haddie shook her head, gave him a grave look and answered, \"I don't know. But I think it's about time we meet our mysterious\u2014\"<br><br>A twig snapped, startling the siblings.<br><br>Before Haddie could finish her thought, the creature stood framed between two trees, dappled in sunlight.<br><br>Jordan screamed in terror as the creature lunged at him, grabbing his arm and sinking its boney claws into his skin. With a mighty roar, the creature hurled him against a tree with a thud. Groaning, he sagged to the ground as inky blackness seeped down over his vision.<br><br>Haddie thought quickly, spotting a fallen branch on the ground.<br><br>The creature inched closer to Jordan, staring at him as though he were a steak. It kneeled before him and prepared to sink its fangs into Jordan's neck to satiate its red thirst. Just as it opened its gaping mouth, a resounding yell interrupted it.<br><br>The creature hissed and turned just in time to receive a branch across the face. It fell to the side, then scrambled to its feet, locking eyes with Haddie.<br><br>Haddie backed away slowly, glad she had saved her brother from certain doom, but unsure what would happen next. Then, inspired by the vampire films she had seen with her uncle Stefan, she turned the sharp side of the branch to face the creature just as it pounced on her like a lion.<br><br>The make-shift stake hit its mark, skewering the creature straight through its monstrous heart.<br><br>The creature shrieked something awful and collapsed to its knees, holding the stake. Wiping her brow, Haddie stepped away from the creature and approached her brother. But a sudden squelching sound froze her to the core. Slowly, she turned to watch the creature pull out the stake with the pulpy, dead heart still attached.<br><br>The creature tossed the heart to the side with a mangled smile. An instant later, it pounced over Haddie, taking her to the ground. Haddie pushed and jerked under its powerful grip as it salivated and peered hungrily at the thick arterial vein pumping in her neck.<br><br>Saliva dripped down Haddie's neck slow, warm and slimy like a slug. She screamed, and then had no breath to scream and began to see not stars but\u2026geometry\u2026 symbols\u2026 symbols she had previously discovered in The Overlap as she often called it. She didn't know what else to call what she understood to be a Venn intersection of worlds where she could see and access knowledge and memories no one else could.<br><br>Haddie closed her eyes and saw the twisted triangle symbol she had just uncovered in an ancient temple. Then she saw the strange circle slashed in half with a line that she had discovered all over the walls and floor of an abandoned asylum as though someone or something was conducting dark experiments in The Overlap on the patients. It was all very bizarre and new to her.<br><br>Now, as the creature prepared to feast on her blood, Haddie wasn't seeing memories pass before her eyes but all these strange and arcane symbols that felt older than life itself\u2014as though someone or something were trying to send her a message from The Overlap.",

Pieces of bone and tooth dropped into a thick puddle of blood and saliva. Haddie turned to see Jordan moaning. He was alive, barely, nevertheless alive.

The symbol wasn't a warning but a seal\u2014a seal to imprison this unfathomable, indescribable creature.<br><br>As the creature prepared to gorge on her life, she managed to grab something sharp off the ground\u2014<br><br>Its broken fang!<br><br>And with the last of her strength, she managed to etch the crescent and the three dots deep into its cheek.<br><br>Suddenly, the creature's eyes widened into great big pools of disbelief. It looked at Haddie in abject terror as it stumbled backward, desperately trying to scratch the symbol off its ghastly face.<br><br>But it was too late.<br><br>Black mist like acid bubbled and burned through the creature's skin. The percolating mist filled its lungs, chest and neck. The belly and chest ballooned as pressure bludgeoned the creature from within. Then, with an agonized shriek, it exploded like a cherry bomb.<br><br>Covered in gore, Haddie dragged herself beside her rousing brother.<br><br>\"What did I miss?\" he groaned and sat up, leaning against the tree. He narrowed his gaze and peered through the thin red mist of blood that hung heavy in the air. \"Where's the\u2014\"<br><br>His voice trailed away as he noticed the shards of bone and chunks of flesh covering his clothes. In silence, they picked off bits and pieces of the creature. Then Jordan broke the silence, saying, \"Well\u2026 this was pleasant\u2026 pleasant as a funeral.\"<br><br>Haddie didn't respond to his stupidity. She was thinking about the symbols they had come across in their investigations. She wondered what they meant, where they came from, and if there was something connecting all these paranormal sites they were being sent to investigate. Moreover, she wondered if their benefactor was using them in some kind of chess game against forces unknown.",

                        "text": "This is the story the tour guide told us after showing us around the old Mad Canyon Distillery in Moonlight Bay. She offered the adults a taste of Ole Bloody, a recipe that had been infamous during prohibition. While we tasted the bathtub gin, no one spoke as the firewater burned down our throats. The tour guide talked about the abandoned distillery we were walking through, telling us about how the first gang had all but disappeared before the legendary Al Capone got his hands on the operation. She must have told the story often as she spoke fluidly and made gestures and pauses at all the right moments.<br><br>\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm not one for tall tales but what we know of the disappearance of the Maddy Hatter Gang is very much a vampire story if ever I heard one. The Maddy Hatter Gang was mostly made up of the Maddock family led by the father Hank who had a thing about collecting hats from the rival gang members he butchered. He must have stolen the wrong hat because that bloodlust came back to haunt him in the fall of 1921 when his gang disappeared with only the youngest of the family left to tell the tale of what had befallen them. And what had befallen them was indeed a great mystery. A mystery people to this day bicker about and dismiss as an urban legend. But I swear it's no legend and all of it is the truth.<br><br>\"The twins Candice and Coddy, while returning with some equipment they had picked up in Ontario, drove into the valley and then carried the copper tubing and flasks into the caves where the gang prepared their white lightning. But when they arrived they found nothing but blood. Blood on the floor. Blood on the walls. Blood, if you'll believe it, running through the tubes and coils of the still. At first, they thought it may have been a rival gang. But there was no sign of bullets or bodies or even a struggle\u2014just blood and an uncanny fog that hung low and heavy in the air.<br><br>\"The twins instantly resolved to find whoever had done this to their gang and moreover they wanted to give their siblings, cousins and parents a proper burial. So they grabbed a lantern and plunged into the twisting bowels of the mountain, following a trail of blood. They searched deep into the night with no result. Coddy shone the lantern and was just about to tell his sister he was beaten when he heard the crunch of stone in the distance. He charged ahead, and she chased after him, stumbling over a boulder, hitting her head against the ground and losing consciousness.<br><br>\"When Candice roused, she sprang to her feet and rushed toward the flickering lantern light, screaming her brother's name. Through dancing shadow and light, she approached her pale brother sprawled over the ground with two small puncture wounds in his neck. She felt his chest for a pulse and gasped when she realized he was dead. She shuddered, then screamed, and moved by an unknown force, she grabbed the lantern and charged forward. Then, without realizing it, she entered a massive cavern, feeling the ground beneath her feet turn to mush.<br><br>\"She shone her lantern around, revealing piles of human skulls amidst thousands of beetles moving through a thick sludge. At her feet, she saw a few beetles devouring a sick bat. She tensed and looked upward to see thousands of bats sleeping. A few beetles scurried over her foot with morsels of rotting flesh and she kicked them away. She swallowed her fear, realizing that if she woke the bats, they would strip her flesh clean in a matter of minutes. Then she glanced at familiar barrels in the corner by a pile of animal bones.<br><br>\"Silently and carefully, she made her way past the bones. Opening the barrel, she cringed as a horrible stench assaulted her nose. She peered at the dark brew and wasn't sure what she was looking at. Then she realized she was staring at fermenting lumps of flesh in thick, putrid blood. She was in the vampire's lair. But before she could continue her search, a roar suddenly startled her.<br><br>\"Candice turned and found herself staring at a demon with fangs with a swirling black fog rising at its feet. Through the fog, she saw it was wearing her father's hat. She gave a shout of revenge like thunder. The vampire twisted its ugly head in startled disbelief. Fearlessly, Candice threw herself at the vampire. She didn't care what this thing was or where it came from. She just wanted it dead, and she wanted to do her family proud. The vampire meant to kill her by sinking its fangs in her neck. But she felt strong enough to bring down a mountain.<br><br>\"And so she jerked and kicked and pushed its snarling face. With a snarl of her own, she bit back at the vampire, tearing pale flesh off its neck with teeth and jaws strong enough to crush rock. Before the vampire realized what was happening, she gouged its eye with her thumb, ramming it deeper and deeper as it desperately clawed flesh off her arms and face. But she didn't care. She would not be denied, and within moments she felt the delicate brain matter like warm mud and smiled. Then she curled her finger and yanked as hard as she could with a mad laugh.<br><br>\"With a shriek, the vampire convulsed violently, then stopped all at once, its jaws frozen in a twisted, agonized howl. Unable to control her growing laughter, she took back her father's hat and stood proudly as open wounds leaked and sputtered blood. Then the fog rolled over the vampire and somehow made it all disappear. The vampire. The bats. The beetles. The blood. Everything.<br><br>\"Needless to say, no one believed Candice and she was put into an asylum to shut-up and wither away. But eventually, some rich philanthropist took charge of her, and she was never seen again.\"<br><br>Everyone was silent. Someone laughed and said, \"That's not really a vampire story, is it?\"<br><br>The tour guide replied, \"Not like we're used to, no. But that's her story and I swear I told it like I heard it.\"<br><br>Then a young woman, in a concerned voice, added, \"I hope that girl ended up all right.\"",

But also, satisfying in its cartoonish simplicity. Wait\u2014what about the plump man with plump fingers? Thick sausages ready to burst with the slightest pinprick. A reminder of the mailman who yelled at him for flinging dog crap at a car. Bastard. I was just a kid having fun. Could fry up that finger and feed it to the local mutt. The fantasy is liberating. A righting of wrongs. And then\u2026 he sees it. The one. He shudders, recoils like he\u2019s seen a ghost, but is suddenly drawn to it, unable to look away. It\u2019s the finger he\u2019s always searched for, always longed to make his own. Attached to a hand, to an arm, to a man with a very stupid moustache. He has found it: the Finger of Chaos.",

He knew a finger just like it. In a different life. Before the circus.<br><br>He\u2019s seven-years-old, in his bedroom, playing with a plastic army man. He throws it against the wall. Bites its head till his tooth hurts. But then, the unexpected: chaos awakens. His father shouts from the living room with a booming voice. Jeffrey retreats to his closet. He hears his father coming down the hall, each step louder. Hide! He buries himself under a pile of dirty clothes and shuts his eyes. The closet door swings open. The odor of cheap beer floods in as a large hand grabs him, pulls him. Why! Why, you little shit? Branson says you kicked his damn dog. That true? Jeffrey\u2019s too afraid to say the words forming in his head: It's true. I walloped the smelly mutt good. Don\u2019t know why. Just something like a reaction. Don\u2019t get twisted about it, ain\u2019t nothing different I coulda done. His father shoves his finger straight into Jeffrey\u2019s face. Speak up, you damned idiot! You think I want to be stuck with you? The finger. Thick, oddly straight, a knuckle with ridges upon ridges of loose skin, a chipped nail that lends it personality. Your mom would have hated you. You listening? Jeffrey can\u2019t look his father in the eyes. He retreats to his imagination. Hack off his finger, Jeffrey! Make dad cry, make the blood spurt. Point the finger right back in his face and laugh. Laugh, Jeffrey! His father looks ready to burst as his face reddens. This funny to you? You some kind of clown? Keep laughing and see what happens. And though Jeffrey fears his punishment, he can\u2019t get the bloody thoughts out of his head\u2014so he laughs and laughs.<br><br>Jeffrey examines Moustache\u2019s finger as the crowd jostles around the circus tent.

No. It was more than a need. It was a longing\u2026 a profound longing to know where he came from and why his father never talked about him.<br><br>But you didn\u2019t have to push him so hard, did you?<br><br>I did. I had to. I had to because I had the right to know who he was. Don\u2019t you see? I have an emptiness inside me that no money or thing can fill. Yet\u2026 he never told me anything about him\u2026 he just distracted himself with the business and all the trappings of a superficial life and\u2014<br><br>Raising you, Jake!

Your father isn\u2019t perfect, and everything he\u2019s done is to give you a better life than he had. He has his reasons.<br><br>And I have mine!<br><br>Jake closes his eyes. He remembers leaving home without saying goodbye. He remembers backpacking across Korea, meeting people who had known his grandfather and could tell him stories about how he had lived. And none of the stories he had been told justified burying the past the way his father had done. He had expected his grandfather to be an abusive, deadbeat and yet\u2026 he had discovered a hero\u2026 a legend even.

Maybe he wanted something else. But why does it matter? Why does it matter right now?<br><br>A voice of caution suddenly brings Jake back to the moment.

You need to eat before you begin to see things that aren\u2019t there. You\u2019ve been at it all morning and afternoon with that make-shift spear, and if you don\u2019t get the hog you\u2019ll end up like me.<br><br>Jake nods with a slight respectful bow as he examines the freshly trampled grass.",

A mocking voice that highlighted and criticized every mistake he made like his dreaded high school English teacher that made him read garbage he didn\u2019t connect with or gave him nicknames like \u2018muddle brain\u2019 for mixings up words, reading backwards and seeing things in the stories she claimed weren\u2019t there. They were. She just lacked imagination and perspective.<br><br>It was her voice\u2014teeth grinding on wool\u2014that squelched through his mind to undermine his dignity and confidence as a thinking human being.<br><br>Jake was convinced his teacher had existed solely to prevent those with other ideas and perspectives from ever pursing a literary career. His father didn\u2019t care about his issue with his English teacher or with teachers in general.<br><br>It didn\u2019t matter.<br><br>Stories didn\u2019t matter.<br><br>Just tell the teacher what she wants to hear. Think of her as your boss and think of grades as money. Parrot her ideas and opinions and you\u2019ll be rewarded with lots of money\u2026 maybe even a bonus or a promotion.<br><br>Easy enough advice to follow.<br><br>And yet his father\u2019s advice did nothing to improve his sense of otherness in relation to the stories and curriculum he was subjected to on an almost daily basis. He still felt like an outsider for lacking interest in the literature and history he was expected to read and memorize as truths undeniable. Seemed like there was a big chunk of perspective missing from the overall narrative being poured into him like concrete that made him feel like he didn\u2019t belong.<br><br>But what does it matter now?<br><br>It doesn\u2019t.<br><br>Leave the past in the past and focus on what needs to get done.<br><br>I\u2019m trying.<br><br>Listen here, big brother\u2026 the sun\u2019s coming down, you\u2019re having conversations with yourself, and your cells are about to cannibalize one another.

The hog turns to Jake and winks.<br><br>Jake stumbles back and falls into the pool.<br><br>The pool swirls and turns into a deadfall as several spikes rip through his chest. Jake yells in agony, waking up with a start, finding himself in a small pit beside thick, sharpened branches pointed outward.<br><br>Jake wipes the sweat off his brow and slowly clambers to his feet. He climbs out of the deadfall and stares into the darkness of the cave for a long moment.

It\u2019s just gonna end up in a shoebox in the attic like his father\u2019s letter.<br><br>You\u2019re wrong.

Jake blinks. And blinks, again. Truth is I let you catch me cause I figured you chased me long enough. Jake shakes his head in disbelief, and he knows his mind is still playing tricks on him despite having eaten. The hog sighs sadly. You and I, Jake, we\u2019re caught in the same vicious cycle so don\u2019t feel so bad, all right? Today it\u2019s me. Tomorrow it\u2019s you.<br><br>Jake pinches himself but the hog continues. Chase something long enough and it will surrender itself to you. It will stop running and let you catch it so long as you stay the course. Just like that story you chased in the old country. Jake narrows his gaze on the grinning hog. Now you\u2019re here on Blood Mountain trying to be your grandfather while trying to forget your father without realizing you\u2019re both and neither of them at the same time.<br><br>Jake tries to shake the hallucination out of his head.

I\u2019m just trying to give you some perspective or rather\u2026 you\u2019re trying to give yourself some perspective.<br><br>Jake sighs deeply. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do and I\u2019m talking to a dead hog in the middle of nowhere. The hog nods. Yes, you are. It\u2019s interesting because your grandfather was poor and didn\u2019t have many options and you\u2019re not so poor and have too many options\u2026 I\u2019m not sure which is worse\u2026 the tyranny of too little or the tyranny of too much\u2026 either way\u2026 a distracted life is a wasted life\u2026<br><br>It\u2019s good that you came out here to figure things out.

You\u2019re still playing the old scripts over and over again like a broken record. But let\u2019s see\u2026 you like chasing stories\u2026 especially the hidden ones\u2026 you talk to yourself constantly\u2026 and you like being alone\u2026 maybe you\u2019re a writer, Jake. Or maybe you\u2019re a historian.<br><br>Jake laughs out loud. Are you kidding me! I hate history, and I failed every English class in high school cause I thought the rules were stupid and the teachers were boring.<br><br>You and every other writer that actually made a dent. English class doesn\u2019t make a writer, Jake\u2026 Fighting class and dancing class do.<br><br>I don\u2019t even know what that means!<br><br>It means you need guts and style, not grades and diplomas. It means you need courage and not the validation of some coward that doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lead someone on a dance floor or step into a ring. It means your country needs a lot more stories like yours. Because let\u2019s face it, Jake, if your story isn\u2019t in the main narrative\u2026 if you\u2019re just a footnote in a history book\u2026 you may as well not exist.<br><br>You\u2019re not your grandfather, Jake. You\u2019re not your father either. And every generation has its challenge. Oppression. War. Separation. Maybe the challenge of your generation is\u2026 representation. You gotta get your stories out there whether you\u2019re a writer, historian, filmmaker or producer. Seems to me a lot of kids like you in the new country need to hear your story or stories like yours to know they aren\u2019t alone. To know they belong and that they aren\u2019t outsiders in their own home.<br><br>A chorus of howls brings Jake back to the moment. Wolves! And they\u2019re coming for what\u2019s mine!

Other Terra Worlds have quite unique and sometimes contradictory versions of the Harbinger series which make them difficult to track and interpret. But despite the discrepancies, each version seems to feature siblings trying to expose a nefarious cult devoted to The Entity.<br><br>I am currently searching the rift for the real memories that inspired all these adventures to see how close they are to the actual inspiration. I\u2019m even wondering if Haddie and Jordan are here, trapped in The Entity, and, if they are, I\u2019m hoping their memories will somehow help me find a way out of here. So far, I have found nothing close to a real memory, but I did find another story from Terra 717 in which Haddie discusses a phenomenon she calls \u2018The Overlap\u2019 and which other stories call The Borro, The Coil, The Bleed, etc.<br><br>I\u2019m currently keeping extensive notes on the Harbinger stories and their descriptions of The Overlap to see if any of them can give me insight into what this phenomenon actually is. What I\u2019ve discovered so far is that almost all of these stories describe places where a dark dimension intersects with the world and that these intersections seem to attract tragedy and misfortune. Some of these stories go so far as to claim \u2018broken\u2019 or \u2018traumatized\u2019 people can derive strange abilities from the vibrations emanating from these dark and \u2018cursed\u2019 places. These people can ultimately use The Bleed\u2014my preferred name for the phenomenon\u2014to access knowledge beyond the veil as it were.<br><br>The Harbinger series from Terra 719 is also worth noting because the details included by the author seem closest to what we studied back home concerning Ancients and living dimensions, not to mention what I\u2019ve been able to discover by examining the memories of souls marooned here.

What are we talking about here?\u201d<br><br>Surin shook his head gravely. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who don\u2019t answer to the police or military.

Crazy stuff, right? \u201d<br><br>Jordan nodded.<br><br>Haddie didn\u2019t respond.

He didn\u2019t talk much about The Overlap but he said what they had seen made him think another world was\u2026 how did he put it\u2026 consuming ours\u2026 like these Overlaps were growing bigger and bigger as we went down a kind of celestial digestive track\u2026 and\u2026 he said\u2026 he said they were pulling stuff out\u2026 things from other worlds\u2026.\u201d<br><br>The woman fell silent and thoughtful for a long moment. \u201cI could see changes in him. He was getting angrier and mean and he was never mean. He stopped sharing things with me. And I started hearing rumors.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat kind of rumors?\u201d Haddie asked, leaning forward.<br><br>The woman went silent and thoughtful. Then she said, \u201cRumors that the government was doing things to them so they could stay in The Overlap for longer periods of time. I even heard that they pulled someone out from another world.

                        "text": "Bullets discharged from a flashing muzzle in the living room as Haddie followed her brother into the basement of the house. They stumbled down the stairs into the darkness and through a beam of sunlight pouring through a rectangular window. Before they could hide, the assassin was already descending the stairs with his rifle trained on them. Haddie and Jordan held hands and closed their eyes waiting for a quick death. A loud report sounded and when they opened their eyes they were both still standing.<br><br>The assassin stared at them with big white eyes of disbelief, then he collapsed to reveal Surin holding a smoking revolver. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to leave before others come.\u201d<br><br>The siblings didn\u2019t hesitate, following Surin up the stairs and out the door past several dead bodies. Haddie counted seven dead assassins by the time she followed her brother into an unmarked black sedan. With a great sense of urgency, Surin started the engine, hit the accelerator and the car peeled away. After a silence, Haddie asked, \u201cIs any of it true? The rumors? Worlds intersecting? The Overlap?\u201d<br><br>Surin didn\u2019t take his eyes off the road as he drove them back to the hotel where their uncle was waiting for them. \u201cI can\u2019t really answer that right now and you need to focus on your next episode. You\u2019re here to investigate the old, abandoned subway station, and I think you should stick to the agenda.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIs it an Overlap?\u201d Jordan asked. \u201cIs that why there were so many accidents? Is that why it was abandoned?\u201d<br><br>Surin hesitated, then nodded gravely.<br><br>\u201cWhat do you and a billionaire care about the old, subway?\u201d Haddie asked.<br><br>Surin sighed, took a moment to find his words, then answered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for my colleagues. We explored these areas all over the world and a few of us never returned and those that did\u2026 they came back to us\u2026 lost\u2026 confused\u2026 insane, even. I want answers. I want to know what happened to the others. I know they\u2019re still alive. They\u2019re lost somewhere\u2026 between worlds.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSo you\u2019re using us to find them?\u201d Haddie said flatly.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re helping each other in mutually beneficial ways.\u201d<br><br>Haddie shook her head. \u201cI need to know more. That\u2019s not enough for me.\u201d<br><br>Surin sighed and pulled the sedan over to the shoulder of the road and killed the engine. After a long thoughtful moment, he looked at the siblings in the rear-view mirror and said, \u201cI was undergoing some, let\u2019s say, unorthodox training to enter The Overlap\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t possible\u2026 it\u2019s like an impossible energy that pulls\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 hell\u2026 pulls hell right out of you\u2026 I mean there\u2019s no other way to describe it. What you feel is just pure darkness. But the OSO figured when the mind is developing it can be\u2026 it can be fractured\u2026 broken in ways so that it rewires itself to withstand the stress of The Overlap.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou turned children into tools!\u201d Jordan spat in disgust.<br><br>Surin looked away from the rear-view mirror and lowered his gaze without answering.<br><br>\u201cAnd so I\u2019m your new tool,\u201d Haddie said. There was a short silence as Haddie considered her last few investigations. She remembered finding journals in the old asylum that had notes about other realms. Memories of other people trapped in a deathless world and journal entries revealing thoughts about how artists and writers were able to somehow tune into these other worlds with what they believed was their imagination but what was actually their third eye. It was a strange theory that Haddie had dismissed as the ravings of a depraved lunatic with a wild imagination. But something the patient had written had stuck with her.<br><br>The truth is in the story.<br><br>Haddie whispered the words to herself and thought she would give those notebooks another read in case she had missed something. She had them stored in her studio apartment in Montreal and would force Stefan to make a detour before their next investigation.<br><br>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Surin continued. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about the friends I lost\u2026 There are things in The Overlap we need to understand. There could be a new type of energy\u2026 a new way of seeing the world\u2026 the universe\u2014\u201d<br><br>Jordan interrupted with a laugh. \u201cOr\u2026 there\u2019s nothing there\u2026 and it\u2019s just a living hell.\u201d",

The spokesperson for the Falls City General Hospital reports an unusual and alarming increase of poison cases due to an unknown spider the size of a fist with bright orange spiral-like markings on its back. The authorities are calling it the hell-back spider and advise you to stay at least two meters away from the spider should you come in contact with one. Federal officials say they are trying to cope with this situation and are still trying to determine if this is in fact a terrorist attack or another phenomenon known as \u2018Spontaneous Evolution\u2019 in which new species suddenly appear without any plausible scientific explanation. Other theories suggest a government experiment gone wrong as in the case of the weaponized ticks carrying the human-made Lyme disease variant that escaped from a classified biological warfare laboratory on Apricot Island. The situation seems to be reaching emergency proportions as more and more districts lose power. The city\u2019s coroner\u2019s office says dozens of corpses now reveal the poison from the hell-back spider to be slow and lethal as boils and puss slowly cover the body. There also seem to be indications that some victims go on murderous rampages induced by fever, overactive adrenal glands and what can only be described as a complete loss of sanity. Infected individuals are to be handled with extreme caution until the boils cover the entire body and movement becomes practically impossible. A representative of the Falls City Power Company says they are actively trying to fix the generators to restore electricity but a strange black fog is slowing down repair crews. Anonymous workers at the company are saying on social media that they are hearing strange sounds coming from the fog and believe it may somehow be linked to the spiders. One report claims a worker\u2019s body burst open with spiders after she inhaled the fog. Another report says that before the initial attacks, carcasses of deer were found with thousands if not millions of spiders crawling out of them. I should repeat that\u2026 There is a fog and it seems to be carrying microscopic eggs that require a biological host\u2026 We advise people to stay calm and take extreme caution if they come in contact with the fog or a hell-back spider.

To get away from the dogs he would hide in the crawl space underneath his cabin, or he would hide in the shed where he kept his snowmobile, or sometimes he would escape to the glaciers and hide in the ice caves where he prayed for the howling and the yelping and the whimpering to stop. But the howling and the yelping and the whimpering never stopped, and no matter where he hid, the dogs always found him.<br><br>The first day Duncan saw the dogs was the day he started questioning his job. Or rather, it was the day he started questioning the law and what he was doing with the law. There was something about legally destroying dogs that felt off\u2026 that felt\u2026 wrong\u2026 something that tugged at his heart and wouldn\u2019t let go\u2026 something telling him that he needed to get out of the cold, lonely Arctic Archipelago before it was too late\u2014if it wasn\u2019t already too late.<br><br>For Duncan, it was the first time in his career as a police officer that he realized that the law wasn\u2019t always the glorified tool for civilization he had imagined it to be. Sometimes the law was something else. Something blunt. Something hard. Something almost like a gavel\u2026 a gavel of destruction or oppression or perhaps both\u2014destruction and oppression.<br><br>Truth is, Duncan wasn\u2019t sure what he was thinking anymore. He was exhausted, and the dogs\u2026 well\u2026 the dogs just wouldn\u2019t leave him be, and all he wanted to do was return home and farm. He liked working on the farm. Things were simpler on the farm. But here, up north, things were more complicated, and Duncan couldn\u2019t help but think about the law.<br><br>About the gavel.<br><br>And the last thing Duncan wanted to do was wield that gavel against anyone. And yet\u2014to his everlasting regret\u2014he had used it against the dogs.<br><br>And though he had done everything by the book\u2026 and though the law said he had committed no crime\u2026 his heart continually testified to the opposite.<br><br>To be sure, Duncan had led countless dogs to the bay, where he had shot them like vermin in front of their owners. And it was only when he was alone and surrounded by their ghosts that he would admit to himself that what he had done didn\u2019t feel so right and that maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 these dogs weren\u2019t the dangerous beasts or the diseased rats his captain had made them out to be. They were\u2026 well\u2026 they were something else.<br><br>They were friends.<br><br>They were family members.<br><br>They played with children, entertained them and kept them safe. They warned against approaching wolves and polar bears, and even snowstorms. And more than anything they made sure no hunter ever got lost in a blizzard unlike those unreliable \u2018iron dogs\u2019 or snowmobiles that broke down in the middle of nowhere and left a trail of black smoke across the cold, white, endless expanse. No \u2018iron dog\u2019 ever led someone out of a blizzard. The same\u2026 well\u2026 the same could not be said of the dogs\u2026<br><br>\u2026the dogs he had so heartlessly destroyed.<br><br>But in those days\u2014when the production of the first commercial \u2018iron dog\u2019 commenced\u2014there weren\u2019t many challenges to the law, and so Duncan certainly tried to convince himself that he was doing the good and lawful thing for everyone.<br><br>And while it\u2019s true that the mind might not make the difference between what is right and what is lawful, the heart certainly does.<br><br>The heart\u2014it is often said\u2014doesn\u2019t lie.<br><br>Nonetheless, Duncan found ways to trick himself and ignore the appeals of his heart. He told himself these dogs weren\u2019t like other dogs, and he actually believed his lie for a few months. But as time wore on, he very quickly realized that these dogs were\u2026 well\u2026 like the dogs he had known back home.<br><br>Knowing this made it harder and harder for him to fall asleep, and soon he started to hallucinate and see all the dogs he had shot.<br><br>At first it was just one. Then it was two. Then a dozen. Then a dozen became a hundred. And a hundred became a thousand. A thousand dead dogs howled and stared at Duncan every night, preventing him from sleeping, from dreaming, from thinking\u2014preventing him from living the life he had once known.<br><br>Everywhere Duncan went, there they were, the dogs, looking at him with those eyes\u2014those pleading, confused eyes, wondering what they had done wrong, or how they had failed their family and friends to deserve such a cold and indifferent end.<br><br>Truth is, Duncan couldn\u2019t escape those ghosts any more than a dog could escape its own tail. Wherever he went, there they were, following him, reminding him of all the lives he had disrupted and destroyed with\u2026 well\u2026 with that gavel.<br><br>One evening, Duncan sat in bed, holding his aching head in his hands, staring at the decaying dogs sitting all around him. They watched him closely as he tried to fall asleep and howled or barked every time his eyelids began to slip. Trembling with fear and exhaustion, Duncan murmured he had done nothing wrong and that he had acted in accordance with the law and that they should just leave him alone. But\u2014<br><br>The dogs wouldn\u2019t leave him alone. They just stared at him in silence with those eyes\u2014eyes that reminded him of his own dog.<br><br>Anguished, Duncan lurched from his bed, screaming at the dogs, telling them he needed to sleep and that he wasn\u2019t going to feel guilty for doing his damn job! He outright refused to apologize or feel guilty for doing what the law required him to do. What the law said he had to do!<br><br>The dogs suddenly stirred anxiously about the cabin with their heads down and tails between their legs. Duncan\u2019s screams grew louder and louder, and one by one, the dogs whimpered and whined for their lives like they had done when they had been destroyed. Then\u2014just like that\u2014they vanished into thin air as though Duncan had finally scared them away.<br><br>When Duncan realized the dogs were gone, he collapsed into his bed and prayed that they should finally leave him alone. He just wanted his life back, for the dogs had robbed him of his strength and freedom and even his sense of identity as a morally upright officer of the law.<br><br>That night, a storm picked up and blew all around his small cabin. Feeling a chill seep through his bones, Duncan rose from the bed, and he made a small fire in the iron stove as he remembered his first and only dog, Buster, a plump Yellow Labrador Retriever with a black snout.<br><br>Smartest, kindest and warmest dog he had ever known.<br><br>To Duncan, Buster was more than just a dog. He was his guardian, his confidant, his best friend. He was the brother he never had. He caught rodents, guarded against coyotes and drove cattle on the farm. His father used to say a good dog was worth two or three farm-hands, and Buster was certainly worth four. Thinking about it now, he was glad that no one ever used the law against Buster, or any other dog in his town for that matter.<br><br>To be sure, Buster wasn\u2019t as big or strong as these Arctic dogs, but he was quite the hunter and had once even saved him from a wolverine. But what Duncan remembered most was that Buster used to curl up in bed with him to calm his anxious heart and help him drift away to sleep.<br><br>And now Duncan longed for nothing more than the undisturbed, soundless sleep of youth. And as he longed for sleep, the wind blew harder and fiercer through the cracks of his cabin. The fire flared, flickered and snapped, casting violent shadows that seemed to tell stories.<br><br>Duncan rubbed his eyes to make the hallucinations go away. But wherever he looked the shadows took the form of officers and hunters shooting at confused and frightened dogs as a thick and unnatural black smoke began to fill the cabin.<br><br>Duncan tried to pinch himself awake. But when he realized he wasn\u2019t asleep, he quickly shut his eyes and once again begged for the dogs to just leave him alone.<br><br>He wanted one night of rest. Just one night! His brain reeled with despair, and he began to hear the warped voice of his captain laughing at him, shouting at him, tormenting him, telling him the dogs were dangerous\u2026 aggressive\u2026 a definite blight on their future plans.<br><br>Duncan felt madness clutching at the seams of his soul. He screamed that these were lies! All of them! And when he opened his eyes again, the black smoke was gone, and the shadows were once again meaningless shapes flickering about the cabin.<br><br>But just as Duncan sighed his relief, he heard a sound.<br><br>A gentle, scratching sound. At the door. Then he heard a bark that sounded vaguely familiar. The bark came again and again and it sounded like\u2014<br><br>Buster.<br><br>Duncan narrowed his gaze and cautiously approached the thick, wooden door. The scratching stopped just as he placed his hand on the doorknob. He stood in silence for a long, tense moment. When the scratching came again, he quickly opened the door and caught a fleeting glimpse of yellow fur disappearing beyond thick sheets of falling snow.<br><br>Exhausted and confused, Duncan rushed into the churning storm in his undergarments and slippers, yelling for Buster to wait for him. Then he stopped suddenly when he realized he was being irrational. His tired mind was playing tricks on him.<br><br>Buster had been dead for over twenty years. He had been hit by a car. And for a fleeting moment, Duncan remembered holding his paw on the side of the road, calming him down as his life slowly seeped away. He had never cried so much in his life. There was no possible way Buster could still be with him.<br><br>Covered in snow, Duncan told himself the solitude was getting to him and that he just needed one night of undisturbed sleep. He turned back toward the cabin. But as he turned, he realized\u2026<br><br>\u2026he was lost.<br><br>He couldn\u2019t see an inch in front of him in any direction. Cold and panic swept over him at once. He turned and turned as the wind howled and shrieked and whimpered. In the raging blizzard, he could only make out\u2014<br><br>Dogs.<br><br>Ghostly dogs. Dead and decaying dogs. Thousands of them. Running around him. Growling. Howling. Barking. Confusing him.<br><br>Duncan shouted for them to stop, and he tried to scare them off as he had done before. But the dogs grew faster and fiercer as though they were one with the storm.<br><br>Duncan fell to his knees and felt the cold bite all over his trembling body. His face twisted in terror as each dog seemed to pounce out of the storm to take its turn chomping down on him with cold, indifferent teeth. He collapsed to his side in agony. A terrible numbness crept over him, not so much from the cold but the memory of hurting all those poor dogs. He begged for them to stop, and then he did what he had never done before.<br><br>He confessed his shame and begged for forgiveness.<br><br>At once, the dogs froze and stared at him with eyes that seemed to look straight into his heart.<br><br>Duncan choked out that he was sorry, that he was truly sorry, and that even though he had done everything by the book, he had done everything wrong. He had done them wrong. He had done their families wrong. And he had done himself wrong.<br><br>And as he emptied his heart, he heard a familiar bark as Buster suddenly emerged from the ghostly pack and stood before him.<br><br>The dogs looked at Buster, then Duncan, then Buster again. A wave of peace seemed to wash over them as they disappeared one by one and left Duncan with his guardian\u2026 his friend\u2026 his brother. And Buster curled down beside Duncan as his heart slowed to a stop, and the blinding, white storm swept his life away as it had done so many others.<br><br><br><br>When Constable Duncan J. Smith didn\u2019t show up at the station the next day, his fellow officers searched for him and found his frozen corpse not ten feet from his cabin. He was lying on his side with a peaceful expression on his face. One officer noticed that he had been running around in circles, while the others questioned why he had been foolish enough to leave his cabin in his undergarments in the middle of a snowstorm.<br><br>The captain kneeled by Duncan\u2019s frozen black and blue face and sighed. Just as he ordered someone to cover the body, another officer panicked and rubbed his eyes, claiming he saw dogs all around him. He stumbled back and screamed for the dogs to stay away from him. No one saw what he was seeing, and the captain told him to stop making jokes at Duncan\u2019s expense. But the frantic officer shrieked in terror and swore that the dogs were real and that they were following him.",

This I realize goes against everything I\u2019ve learned about Ancients back home. But I cannot deny that all the stories and memories I\u2019ve been examining suggest a voluntary and not involuntary will to create and destroy on the part of this Ancient. It\u2019s all speculation at this point but the last realm that opened up in the basement allowed me to venture into Terra Arachna where I witnessed the fall of a world to massive, spider-like creatures\u2014monsters that could have only come from The Entity. Not wanting any of those monsters escaping into the tower, I quickly etched a symbol into the basement door to make the realm disappear. Then, just to be certain, I opened the door and all that was left of the apocalypse was a small, empty room covered in dust. But, as I examined the room, I thought I heard a kind of chittering sound in the corridors. I swallowed a growing lump in my throat and cautiously searched the tower to make sure nothing had escaped. I didn\u2019t find anything inside, but noises outside continue to disturb my sleep, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen things moving in the fog.",

The emotion of thousands is guided by his voice. He is seen by all, he is loved, and he is wonderous.<br><br>Ji-Woon never played his flute again. He reveled in sounds that reached global audiences, attracted screaming fans, turned men and women into idols. His childhood fear vanished as he learned to divulge himself through the intricacy and pliability of pop, his inner thoughts riding atop soundwaves, fusing together with other genres\u2014rock, hip hop, jazz, punk. It was the music that could deliver him the explosive fame he deserved, a promise that he would never be upstaged.

Looking through her mailbox, she spots a dozen unread emails from an unknown user addressing her by name. Few know her as Yun-Jin. Most only know her as Magnum Opus. She clicks on an email.<br><br>A graphic, detailed description of someone's plan to murder her and the Trickster. Signed, the Trickster's number one fan. Death threat. An abnormally specific one with a picture of her in the hotel lobby.<br><br>Before the death of NO SPIN, she ignored such threats. But now\u2026 her manicured hand shake as she reaches for her phone.<br><br>The threat is too serious to be taken lightly. She calls her security crew for an emergency meeting. Outings are restricted to recording sessions and concert rehearsals only. A bodyguard is assigned to the Trickster and herself.<br><br>Everyone complies with the new rules except for the Trickster, who argues against staying on the hotel premises. No surprises there. Her relationship with the Trickster has been on the rocks for months now. He challenges every decision she makes, his ego pushing her patience to its limit. Because of their frequent creative disagreements, their next album is behind schedule, forcing her to produce three new songs while overseeing his tour.<br><br>Her security expert confirms that the phones are ready. At her request, a tracking GPS application was installed on all company phones. No one else knows about this. If the Trickster keeps testing her patience, this app will come in handy.

An anonymous post claims that the victim was last seen alive at the Trickster's VIP meet-up after his concert in New York early this year. Yun-Jin remembers that night. Not because of the concert, but because of a detail that has been replaying in her mind ever since. Bleeding scratch marks on the Trickster's forearms when he showed up at the concert\u2019s afterparty. The rumors online were rekindling the suspicion she silenced before.<br><br>Years ago, the Trickster and she arrived in Miami several days earlier than planned. Yun-Jin attended networking events while the Trickster rehearsed. Three days following their arrival, a folksinger was found dead downtown, near the bar where he performed. A security footage was released to the public showing a man dressed in black with his face covered, leading the singer down an alley. The dark, blurry footage revealed little about the suspect. But Yun-Jin noticed a detail that twisted her stomach in knots. She recognized the gold rimmed headphones around the suspect\u2019s neck with two large \u201cXs\u201d, one for each ear. It was the brand-new model of the Xerxes 1050x headphones, which few audiophiles knew about and even fewer could afford. She recognized the model right away because the Trickster favored their equipment over other expensive models. He wore a similar pair on the plane to Miami, but then switched to a lesser model for the rest of the tour, which only fueled her doubts.<br><br>Back then, however, she was not in a good place. The death of NO SPIN was still fresh. Acute insomnia kept her mind in a haze and the jet lag of the tour only worsened her state. In the end, she decided to let the police do their job and focus on hers; producing music. But now someone else was dead, someone whom the Trickster might have been the last one to see alive. The headphones, the scratch marks, and the late-night outs were details, but they added up.<br><br>How many coincidences does it take to know?<br><br>A knock on the door makes her jump. The head of security is here. Yun-Jin follows her gut. She confronts him. She bluffs about firing the whole security crew if he does not come clean. It pays off. She learns that the Trickster left the hotel premises last night. His bodyguard tried to follow but lost him on the way.<br><br>Yun-Jin pounds her fist on the table.<br><br>Why would he leave the hotel? To go where? And\u2026 to do what?<br><br>Despite working with the Trickster for years, he is still no more than a stranger. While he generates incredible profit, it comes at a cost. If the Trickster is linked to a murder, so is she. Even if there is no evidence. Even if it\u2019s just rumors. It\u2019s her life on the line. Her entire career. She could never produce music again. And the worst part is\u2026 it's her own fault. She knows better than to trust someone in this industry.<br><br>She needs to get answers, before it is too late. Whatever the Trickster is doing at night, she must find out. Her doubts won\u2019t be quieted until she knows for certain.",

All she finds is a gym bag.<br><br>Inside lies a water bottle, a few t-shirts, and his wallet. No bills or anything of interest in his wallet\u2026 except for his hotel room keycard. Perhaps she is looking in the wrong place. Someone chatting loudly on the side of the door alerts her.

Come back later.<br><br>She finds nothing odd in the room, except for a rare, top-of-the-line sampler on his bedside table. Intrigued, she presses play. A series of loud, violent screams fill the room. The screeches sound\u2026 genuine. Samples from a horror film?<br><br>Yet she cannot fully shake her initial, disturbing thought. What if it is\u2026 genuine?<br><br>What she finds next only enhances her discomfort. A sharpening kit for knives. Wet stones and cleaning products. A whole collection of sharpeners.<br><br>A past conversation overheard at the recording studio replays in her mind. Lucas, the young artist, introducing himself to the Trickster, asking about the flamboyant knife in his hands. The Trickster replying that he always keeps a blade on him.<br><br>Yun-Jin picks up a wet stone. Why sharpen a stage prop? Sure, the Trickster used real knives to do stunt work as a kid, but it is no longer necessary. This obsession with knives is not just for show. And what is the point of sharpening a knife if it's not to use it? She shudders.<br><br>Another noise at the door. Yun-Jin puts down the wet stone.<br><br>I said come back la--<br><br>Trickster walks into the room, catching her off guard.\u202fHer eyes meet his.<br><br>He is just the awkward kid I signed years ago. I will not let him drag me down.<br><br>His outrage meets her fury. Yun-Jin picks up the sampler.<br><br>Where the hell do you wander off at night? And what is this twisted horror bullshit? What if the media got ahold of it? Your career would be over.<br><br>Trickster sighs and admits that after the death of NO SPIN, his mind drifted to a dark place. He rarely talks about their death, and she can tell why. That day still haunts her dreams. Time passes, but guilt remains.<br><br>Yun-Jin spots his phone on the table.<br><br>Grab a drink from the mini bar, Trickster.

Eventually, all tests will be her responsibility alone. When the time comes, she must be ready.<br><br>Amanda points her flashlight at the blueprint of Gideon's underground and retraces her steps. While examining the vast tunnel network, another thought crosses her mind. Soon, Gideon will be her domain. A thrilling sensation of alarm and excitement follows that thought.<br><br>Her flashlight illuminates a familiar fork in the tunnel: left leads to the underground bathroom, and right leads to the meat plant\u2019s wastewater.<br><br>To follow in John\u2019s footsteps, she must craft a test that aligns with Grace's flaw: a corrupt ambition to rise and become mayor, while sacrificing the health of thousands. It is time to give the mayor a dose of her own poison. Amanda crawls into the tunnel on her right.",

                        "text": "Mahan Singh spent seventeen years amassing a fortune for his estranged niece by leading mercenary missions all over the world for Leviathon Securities. A decorated soldier in the Indian army, Mahan was discharged after thirteen years of service for disobeying orders while on assignment for the United Nations. Shortly afterward, he joined Leviathon and found himself on a series of strange assignments that involved securing haunted locations and procuring strange artifacts of an occult nature. Locations and artifacts that seemed worthless but were of grave importance to governments and organizations for some reason or another. Mahan didn't know what to make of it. To him, it all felt like a kind of invisible war between secret societies that were somehow able to use governments and corporations like pieces on a chessboard for a bunch of old, moldy books and geometric trinkets from forgotten civilizations.<br><br>Now Mahan was pinned behind a crumbling wall in a village in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya with his fallen unit scattered in pieces all over the surrounding dirt roads. He had been fighting all day against different units and was fresh out of luck and ammunition.<br><br>There\u2019s no way out of here, he told himself. I\u2019ve got no support, no ammunition, no luck. Why do you need luck when you have a weapon and your wits? You\u2019ve been in worse situations and survived. Think you are beaten and you are beaten. I am beaten. You are almost beaten, and that\u2019s not the same thing.<br><br>Suddenly, Mahan heard the surrounding mercenaries yelling at one another in Russian. They were planning an attack and coordinating with one another. He peeked around the corner, then ducked fast as several rounds punched holes into the wall sending clouds of dust and stone into the air. He cursed in Punjabi, grabbed his automatic rifle, then craned his head ever so slightly to see fast-moving silhouettes against the full moon closing in on his position. Quickly, he crawled into a nearby home and hid the asset\u2014the ancient scroll\u2014underneath several corpses of British agents he had killed just before the Russians had decided to join their party. Then he hid in the shadows, holding his rifle by the barrel, refusing to die without a fight.<br><br>They probably all work for The Collector, he told himself. Crazy rich man with too much time and money on his hands. Shah just wants to make sure he gets the scroll before another eccentric billionaire beats him to it. And from where does this prize come? It supposedly comes from a lost, elder civilization with advanced and forbidden knowledge. Nonsense, all of it. A bunch of ancient stories about pagan priests and barbaric rituals and cosmic deities told around a campfire. Ancient sci-fi, at best.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Mahan heard their almost inaudible footfalls before he saw them. His eyes narrowed and his face hardened as two mercs entered the moonlit doorway. With a groan, he launched himself into the air, smashing the butt of his rifle against one head and then the other.<br><br>Both mercs collapsed to the ground unconscious. A split-second later, Mahan yanked a loaded rifle from the hands of one of the fallen mercs and rushed through the doorway taking cover behind a well spilling over with thick buzzing flies like living black soup. Inside the well were the rotting bodies of those who had sought the scroll but had found death instead.<br><br>Mahan buried his nose in his arm and suppressed an instinct to retch. Then, seeing a merc, he lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. Bullets tore holes through the neck and face as the mercenary staggered back and forth, then fell against a wagon with the pulpy head hanging by a shred of flesh.<br><br>As he searched the shadows for other mercs, Mahan suddenly heard the crunch of stone behind him. He whirled to fire\u2014<br><br>A second too late.<br><br>Several rounds pounded into his Kevlar vest like a jackhammer, sending him stumbling backward into the black soup of death. A moment later the surviving mercs loomed over the mouth of the well as a thick black fog coiled around them like a snake.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Mahan closed his eyes and waited for a death that never came. Instead of a report ripping though the darkness like a clap of thunder, he heard a scream followed by a cry and then shrieks of agony. When he opened his eyes, the mercs were gone as though they had been erased by the fog.<br><br>Mahan struggled through the putrid blood and fluids to climb up and out of the well. As he pulled himself over the gore-covered mouth he noticed the world had been plunged into an abyss of fog. Before he could make any sense of what was happening, something snatched his ankle\u2014hard\u2014and tried to pull him back down.<br><br>Desperately, Mahan gripped the edge of the well and held on tightly. He looked to his feet where he saw multiple hands yanking and clutching at his legs. He held on for dear life but his hands slipped in the blood and gore and soon gave way. With a terrible cry, he fell back into the gore as boney hands clawed at his legs, his arms, his throat, his beard, his nose, his turban and pulled him deeper and deeper into the darkness.<br><br>Needless of pain burst inside his head as he drowned in thick, fermenting blood. He knew with a strange resignation that he was dying, or that he was already dead, and that he would never know his niece or what had become of her. After his wife and parents had died in a plane crash and his brother had disappeared, she was the only one left. She was his only family, and he swore he would always take care of her.<br><br>But then life happened, and in the end, he had only taken care of himself. He had lived a lonely, selfish life counter to his upbringing and his beliefs. He was a walking contradiction who had somehow convinced himself that he was cursed, that everyone he had ever loved died or disappeared, and that he was doing his niece a favor by staying out of her life. He had somehow convinced himself that he was keeping his bad luck away from her while he amassed a fortune that he would one day leave her.<br><br>But Mahan knew it was all a lie. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about nurturing and raising a human being. Raising his brother\u2019s daughter terrified him and that\u2019s why he had clung to any reason he could to abandon her. All he knew was killing and destroying in the name of governments and corporations. And as the darkness swallowed him whole, Mahan realized in horror that killing and destroying was all he would ever know.<br><br>Mahan had failed his ancestors. He had failed his family. He had failed his brother and his niece. He would never know her hopes, her dreams, her likes, or dislikes\u2026 He would know nothing except the inky blackness that swept over his eyes and the unnamable terrors that awaited him in the great unknown.<br><br><br><br>MAHAN OPENED HIS EYES WITH A START. He was still in the well, submerged in the putrid, death stew, staring up at thick black fog drifting over him as he heard a whirring sound\u2014the sound of a motor accelerating and decelerating somewhere in the distance. He took a moment to gather his senses. He didn\u2019t remember much. He remembered being shot, stumbling back and falling into the well. Everything after that moment felt like a nightmare that had been inspired by one of his father\u2019s stories\u2014the one where unarmed, peaceful protestors were shot dead and stuffed into a well and left to rot in the blistering Punjab heat.<br><br>With a painful groan, Mahan reached out with trembling hands to a jutting rock and, with difficulty, pulled himself free from the gore. Rock by rock, he climbed his way up the festering throat of the well and finally pulled himself over the mouth and into the thick black fog.<br><br>A cry sounded over the incessant whir of the machine and Mahan quickly realized he wasn\u2019t in Kenya anymore. He stood and took in his surroundings. There were strange structures like factories submerged in the fog. Scattered around the structures were piles of clothes and bodies set ablaze. Above in the pale red sky crows circled and cawed adding to the oppressive cacophony.<br><br>\u201cHelp\u2026 please\u2026\u201d<br><br>Mahan heard a woman crying for help coming from a bank of fog. Snapping out of his daze, he extended his hands and waved a tunnel through the fog, searching for the source of the sound.<br><br>\u201cHelp\u2026 someone\u2026 please\u2026 \u201d<br><br>The disembodied voice reached him again, and she somehow seemed close and far at the same time. He froze to listen carefully, but all he could hear was the incessant whirring of the motor accelerating and decelerating.<br><br>\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d<br><br>There it was again. He moved left, then right, and finally he reached a woman in pilot fatigues stuck in a trap of twisted barbed wire. Without a word, he pulled the metal thorns out of her legs as she winced and squirmed in pain with every movement. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened or how I ended up here\u2026\u201d Her voice trailed away, and she seemed bewildered.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d Mahan asked as he struggled with the barbed wire.<br><br>The pilot stumbled back and answered with intermittent groans as she nursed her wounds. \u201cI was on patrol\u2026 soaring through clear blue skies\u2026 when this black cloud suddenly appeared\u2026 and then the plane began to shake and break apart and\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 I was here\u2026\u201d<br><br>A sudden click and they both turned wide-eyed to face the barrel of a rifle. Behind the rifle a man in black fatigues appraised them. \u201cWho the fuck are you two?\u201d<br><br>Mahan raised a hand. \u201cWait! Careful\u2026 we\u2019re not a threat. We\u2019re just as confused as you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWho are you and what are you doing in Texas? Are you CIA? Is this some kind of a test?\u201d<br><br>Mahan gritted his teeth. \u201cThis ain\u2019t a test. And I\u2019m pretty sure this ain\u2019t Texas.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWho are you?!\u201d<br><br>The agent shoved his rifle in Mahan\u2019s face. But before Mahan could answer a Japanese woman in a black and red kimono emerged from the fog, unsheathing a katana with a high-pitched ring. She yelled at them in Japanese, and Mahan extended a calming hand to her. \u201cPlease\u2026 put the sword down\u2026\u201d He then turned to the agent. \u201cPlease\u2026 put the gun down\u2026 let\u2019s figure this out. \u201c<br><br>\u201cWho are you!\u201d the agent yelled, pushing the muzzle in Mahan\u2019s face. \u201cI won\u2019t ask again!\u201d<br><br>\u201cI can tell you who I am, but that\u2019s not the question, is it?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYeah! What\u2019s the question, then?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhere?\u201d Mahan said flatly, motioning to the destroyed factories, the craters and the smoldering piles of trash and bodies. \u201cI should think the question is: Where? Where are we?\u201d<br><br>Another voice came from behind. \u201cHe\u2019s right, you know. \u201c<br><br>Mahan turned to watch a man with a police jacket emerge from the fog. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure that one out\u2026 but right now we should all be asking: How?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow?\u201d Mahan repeated.<br><br>\u201cYes,\u201d the detective said. \u201cHow much time do we have before The Horror finds\u2014\u201d<br><br>Before he could finish his sentence, a shriek followed by and high-pitched whine startled them. A moment later a mass of melded humanity and machine came at them.<br><br>Mahan could make out several heads all shrieking battle cries in different languages attached to a patchwork of charred scraps from missiles, tanks, fighter jets, and nuclear submarines all bearing flags and strange logos of brands from different periods he vaguely remembered. He stared at this monstrous chimera in shock and wasn\u2019t quite sure what he was looking at.<br><br>The Horror, he called it. Looks more like the embodiment of war\u2014sponsored war.<br><br>Mahan swallowed a thickness growing in his throat as The Horror rushed the stunned agent and tore his head off, swallowing the terrified face and dripping neck like a ripe cherry. Then its ghastly mouth opened wide and a stream of fire torched the jerking, headless corpse as it collapsed into a heap of industrial garbage.<br><br>Not waiting to be next, the samurai lunged at the monstrosity and, with incredible speed and precision, cut it to pieces. Then all of them watched in disbelief as the pieces of flesh and metal slowly disintegrated into the living fog.<br><br>The detective sighed. \u201cIt will be back,\u201d he said, appraising the samurai. \u201c18th or 19th Century. Red Crown Clan. You\u2019re not the first. We could definitely use your skills here.\u201d<br><br>The samurai sheathed her katana and grasped at the fog as though trying to capture pieces of it to study\u2014as though she recognized it.<br><br>Mahan approached the detective. \u201cWhere exactly is here?\u201d<br><br>But the detective didn\u2019t answer. He merely turned his back on them and walked away, saying, \u201cFollow me\u2026 if you want to escape.\u201d<br><br>Mahan took in a deep breath and gathered his senses. Then he took to his heels and followed the detective into the unknown with the samurai and the fighter pilot in tow.<br><br><br><br>MAHAN FOLLOWED THE DETECTIVE through a labyrinth of bombed-out factories and mountains of garbage set ablaze. At the center of this industrial hell was a giant machine with hooks and cameras and television screens of every possible brand and size broadcasting moments of Mahan\u2019s life as though his brain was a Wi-Fi signal that could stream his memories\u2014his darkest memories. And not just his memories, but the memories of the samurai, the pilot, and the detective. It was as though they had been selected by some unnamable and incompressible intelligence for mere entertainment.<br><br>The detective stopped when he reached what seemed to be a submarine hatch surrounded by a pile of smoldering trash and mangled, charred bodies.<br><br>\u201cGet in!\u201d he yelled, opening the hatch. \u201cI'll explain what I know when we\u2019re safe.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhere does it lead?\u201d Mahan asked.<br><br>\u201cAway from here,\u201d the detective said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all you should care about right now. We don\u2019t have time for explanations. But when we\u2019re safe, Ben will answer all your questions as best he can. Right now, you need to\u2014\u201d<br><br>A clanking noise suddenly interrupted him.<br><br>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d The detective yelled as The Horror came at them from the shadows. Instantly, he pulled out his flashlight, distracting The Horror as Mahan and the others escaped down the hatch.",

                        "text": "The sound of a bottle clanging against the ground greeted Haddie as she entered the half-burned building that had gone up in flames nearly a week ago. Thick, smoky air stung her nose as she stepped over shards of glass and heaps of charred wood. Bright city lights spilled through the shattered windows and crumbling walls. Carefully, Haddie picked her way across the floor toward the elevator, where she found the door leading to the stairs. A sign on the door warned her that the entire structure would be demolished in the morning.<br><br>There\u2019s still time, she thought, as she ascended the narrow stairs. I\u2019ve got a few hours to convince Max that he\u2019s not crazy, that he\u2019s not losing his grip on reality and that something is happening to our world. Something only a few of us can see and feel.<br><br>Haddie reached the last door at the top of the stairs and pushed her way onto the roof. There she spotted a man sitting on the ledge with thick, tangled hair and a weathered army jacket, drinking himself to oblivion as he stared out at the bright lights of the city.<br><br>She approached him slowly, and he didn\u2019t react or even turn to regard her when she sat down beside him. She merely sat in silence, listening to the police sirens wail in the distance over the horns and the muffled music coming from the clubs and bars below. At last, she said, \u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d<br><br>Max took a few swallows of rum. \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cBut I know you, Maxwell.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t care where you\u2019re from. I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes, I can see that. You want to drink.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerceptive,\u201d he said sarcastically, then extended the bottle toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo, thank you, Mr. Holt.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI know much more about you, Max.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou CIA? FBI?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf I were, you\u2019d already be dead,\u201d Haddie said. \u201cYou were an Olympic Biathlon athlete. You were a soldier. Iraq. Syria. Afghanistan. You left the military after an incident and after that you kind of pulled yourself off the grid.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou know how to use a search engine. You get a gold medal. Now leave me alone to my quiet time.\u201d Max raised the bottle and took another swig.<br><br>Haddie narrowed her eyes and looked to the shadows on the roof beyond him. She couldn\u2019t see anything but she could hear disembodied voices talking to him. She shut them out, then leaned closer to him. \u201cI know you see and hear things others can\u2019t. I know they follow you. I know you want them to stop. And I didn\u2019t get all that from a search engine.\u201d<br><br>Max lowered the bottle from his lips and fixed his gaze on a couple arguing on the sidewalk below. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I hear\u2026 what I see\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cThings from another place. Another world. Another realm.\u201d<br><br>Max swallowed a growing lump in his throat.<br><br>Haddie paused, then continued:<br><br>\u201cSomething otherworldly attacked your unit and you survived because of your abilities and now\u2026 no one believes a word of it. You were ridiculed, discharged and silenced with an endless supply of opioids to fog your memory and neutralize your questions.\u201d<br><br>Haddie stopped as his eyes filled with tears.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy, Max. You saw what you saw, and no drug or drink in the world will relieve the guilt or stop the nightmares. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, isn\u2019t it\u2026 Waiting for morning to make it all stop.\u201d<br><br>Max cleared his throat. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYour skills and abilities on my team.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd what team is that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe one that is trying to stop the end of the world.\u201d<br><br>Max laughed uproariously, then stopped at once. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d<br><br>Haddie grabbed the bottle out of his hands, took a swig, handed it back to him and nodded gravely.<br><br>Max shook his head. \u201cWhat do you know about what happened to my unit?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot much,\u201d Haddie admitted. \u201cWhat I do know is there are some very powerful people who have the answers or think they have the answers you\u2019re looking for. What I do know is that since I was a teen I\u2019ve been caught in the crossfire between two warring groups that need people like us to access this other realm and bring things back. I\u2019ve been running from them for the last forty years, and I have helped others like us from suffering an unknown fate at their cruel hands.\u201d<br><br>Max\u2019s face hardened. \u201cThey laughed at me. They said something in me snapped and that I had imagined the fog and the creatures that came out of it.\u201d<br><br>Haddie shook her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t imagine anything. I lost my brother in the same way.\u201d<br><br>They exchanged a look.<br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead\u2026 I can still hear him\u2026 I do\u2026 but I can\u2019t see him\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d<br><br>Haddied shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. All I know is we\u2019re not the only ones who lost friends and loved ones to this phenomenon. And if we work together we might one day see them again.\u201d<br><br>Max laughed and pulled on his bottle. \u201cSo you\u2019re recruiting me? Is that what you\u2019re doing? Recruiting me in some kind of paranormal army.\u201d He laughed, again in disbelief.<br><br>Haddie watched him laugh. \u201cI\u2019m giving you what you need.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cA second chance,\u201d Haddie answered flatly. \u201cPurpose. Meaning. A chance to save others from being murdered or used by the same assholes who are coming for you right now as we speak.\u201d<br><br>Max laughed. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Who\u2019s coming for me?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI have a list\u2014\u201d<br><br>Haddie broke off abruptly. She pulled out a gun from her jacket and shot two dim figures in the head as they emerged from the exit door. She then jerked to her feet and hurried to the bodies, searching their jackets for IDs without any success. \u201cThey\u2019ll be more,\u201d she said, looking up at Max as he stepped beside her with wide, confused eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re at the top of their list and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat list? What are you talking about?\u201d<br><br>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Haddie said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d<br><br>Max nodded, dropped his bottle with a loud clang, and followed Haddie down the stairs, through the charred building, and out into the ally where a cab was waiting for them.<br><br><br><br>MAX HOLT STOOD IN THE BASEMENT of the Park & Sherwood bookstore examining a wall of pictures, notes and numbers covered by a web of red string highlighting connections. He narrowed his gaze on hundreds if not thousands of missing people from all over the world. Tacked between the pictures and notes were transcripts of horror stories from various podcasts decoded into numbers and coordinates. He then glanced around the room and noticed artifacts and artwork from ancient civilizations he did not recognize from any history book he had ever read, and he had read many. He turned back to the wall and noticed for the first time a picture of his unit in Afghanistan among countless other units that were missing in action. His face grew stern, his eyes narrowed, and he turned to Haddie and asked, \u201cIs this the list?\u201d<br><br>Haddie stepped beside him. \u201cThis is the list of those we failed.\u201d Her eyes fixed on a picture of her brother at a World War Two zeppelin crash site in the French Alps where they had recovered several \u201cWunder Weapons\u201d that a secret unit of German soldiers was transporting for the Thule Society. It was the last time she had seen him before he had disappeared. \u201cThe list is of those that are being targeted by some very powerful and disturbed elites. They will either be killed in ritual sacrifice, or they will be used as tools to search areas that overlap with another dimension.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to take in. But these groups\u2026 they communicate through random podcasts and deliver encoded messages in stories and media. And we do our best to decode them.\u201d<br><br>Max scoffed. \u201cIs this some kind of joke? Codes in stories\u2026 That\u2019s your list?\u201d<br><br>Haddie shook her head. \u201cThis is real. There are people who are in serious danger, and you can help them. You left the government because they laughed and ridiculed you. That won\u2019t happen with us. We know what you saw is real.\u201d<br><br>Max approached the picture of his unit.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve got names and places and endless funds at my disposal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re twelve to midnight, and only a few of us know it, and I need you on our team, not theirs.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMinutes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cSeconds. Twelve seconds.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThese groups,\u201d Max queried. \u201cAre they that powerful?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d<br><br>Max extended his hand, touching the picture of his unit. He then followed a red string to a passage culled from a horror story. From the passage, he followed yet another string to a series of numbers\u2014the time, day and place the creatures in the fog attacked them.<br><br>Haddie stepped away and soon returned with a folder, pulling out a picture of an abandoned cemetery in Chile along with a picture of a man. She handed the pictures to Max, and he stared at them for a long, thoughtful moment before nodding that he would join her team.",

                        "text": "Several paths lead to the harbor where peasants and merchants had witnessed the strange arrival of a foreign ship. They discussed the ship and the arrival in the surrounding villages with mingled anger, fear and curiosity. Most believed the foreigners were here to disseminate contraband and rob their beloved land of precious artifacts. Many believed a band of thieves was selling these precious goods to these foreigners in exchange for their weapons. Some even claimed that they had seen these thieves on the gangway, loading stolen artifacts and relics from fallen lords and noble families onto their ship.<br><br>Saku Nakano stood in the moonlight, considering her options. There was the long and safe route along the dirt road, and there were shorter routes through the dark and deadly woods where many unlucky villagers had been killed by creatures\u2014it was said\u2014not of this world.<br><br>Saku knew of these cursed places all too well. She had lost her entire clan to these mist-enshrouded areas over the years and now she roamed the country\u2014the last of The Red Crown Clan\u2014seeking out the great corruption that was upon her people, finishing what her clan had started centuries ago.<br><br>The enemies to her clan, The Black Serpent Society, served a nine-headed serpent made of black mist. They believed the black serpent would grant them powers and boons beyond human comprehension in this world and the next in exchange for unquestioning devotion. They were convinced that the black-mist serpent was a demon that slithered through these wooded cursed areas creating doorways into what they called The Belly of the Serpent, or just, The Belly.<br><br>Saku turned toward the dark woods, and sensing raw evil in her midst, she prepared to enter, thinking about the hushed conversations she had overheard in the nearby markets. She remembered the merchant hacking and gutting fish as he talked to a woman who was going through a bag of oysters she had just gathered in the sea. She remembered them talking about how they had seen bandits with pistols and gunpowder and other strange weapons.<br><br>I remember them mentioning the foreigners, she thought. They said they were Dutchmen. They were on the wharf speaking fluent Japanese with unknown merchants in plain kimonos with the exception of a strange serpent crest. They described the crest as a nine-headed serpent twisted in a circular knot as it chased its nine tails. They described only a few sailors and how most of the crew had perished of an unnamed disease during the voyage across the ocean.<br><br>A sudden laugh interrupted her thoughts.<br><br>\u201cWhere is your husband? \u201c<br><br>A man in a plain brown kimono looked her up and down in the pearly light of the moon as he approached her.<br><br>Saku met his gaze but did not react or respond.<br><br>The man placed his hand lightly on the hilt of his sword as he continued to appraise her. She was tall and lean with strong, sinuous arms and piercing dark eyes. She had long, black oiled hair gathered in a perfect queue, doubled over and tied neatly with a red and white sash. She wore thong sandals and a simple black kimono. A vibrant red sash around her waist held two scabbard swords. One sword was short and straight, the other was long and curved at the tip.<br><br>\u201cWhere are your papers?\u201d<br><br>The man edged closer to her with dim recognition in his eyes. He had heard rumors of an Onna-Musha in a black and red kimono roaming the land, destroying the wicked while protecting those who could not protect themselves. Or did she roam the land seeking justice for her butchered clan? Or was she a bandit leader who raided and pillaged villages?<br><br>The man couldn\u2019t quite remember what he had heard, and he had forgotten the name people had given her. It was related to her clan and its origin. That much he knew, but not much more. It would have helped if he had paid closer attention when his wife had been discussing her many adventures with her sisters.<br><br>But he had ignored most of the stories as exaggerated gossip and legends not unlike that other samurai that everyone called a demon. There was no such thing as a demon samurai and there was certainly no such thing as a woman samurai that could perform all the feats the stories claimed she had performed.<br><br>Saku breathed deeply and placed her hand near the hilt of her long sword.<br><br>\u201cDo you not see I am addressing you! Where are your papers! Answer me wo\u2014\u201d<br><br>With impossible speed, Saku whirled her sword in a gleaming silver arc and the man\u2019s torso toppled off his hips and a fountain of warm crimson fed the ground. The twisted mouth twitched as it sputtered bile and blood and tried to make out the words, \u201cRedcrane.\u201d<br><br>He had remembered\u2014<br><br>A moment too late.<br><br>Returning her sword to its scabbard, Saku sighed and said an inward prayer for the brute. Then she stepped over his jerking torso and entered The Belly of the Serpent.<br><br><br><br>WITH CAREFUL, SILENT STEPS, Saku pushed smoothly through The Belly, paying close attention to the lurking black mist slithering through gnarled trees that seemed to shift and waver with her every step, as though to intimidate her.<br><br>Don\u2019t make a sound, she thought, stepping down a slope through noiseless shadows toward the sound of waves crashing against rocks. She was close to the wharf. She could smell the seaweed, fish and salt in the air.<br><br>There was also something else.<br><br>A strange heaviness in the atmosphere.<br><br>Staring up through the shaking canopy, she saw thick clouds marching across the sky. She sensed the floor moving, and looked down to see her legs completely submerged in the creeping mist. A moment later a branch cracked not ten paces away, and she knew she wasn\u2019t alone anymore.<br><br>Saku neither ran nor hid. She froze, closed her eyes, listening carefully for threats approaching through the black mist that heaved and moved as though it were alive.<br><br>Saku knew she was somehow\u2014as difficult as it was to explain\u2014in two worlds at once. And she knew there were demons and monsters in the other world that hunted within these overlapping areas.<br><br>Saku didn\u2019t know much about this other world. What she knew she had learned from her mother and father. The Black Serpent Society\u2014they had once explained\u2014believed the black-mist serpent was a living deity that consumed people, towns, civilizations and worlds.<br><br>The Black Serpent Society believed that within The Belly there was lost knowledge and power from all these consumed worlds that could help them usher in a golden age of peace, prosperity and abundance. Their dedication, their devotion, their ritualistic killings were, in the end, for the betterment of humanity.<br><br>The Red Crown Clan, however, believed the promise of a golden age was nothing more than a cosmic ruse\u2014a shiny gold lure to snag minnows, fish and whales in the abyss.<br><br>With a deep breath, Saku sensed the threats were gone. She opened her eyes and continued through wavering light and shadow as the wind began to pick-up and the mist grew thicker. But then she stopped suddenly when she heard a familiar roar.<br><br>A thunderous roar that seem to shake the world.<br><br>This time she didn\u2019t close her eyes.<br><br>She didn\u2019t run.<br><br>This time she silently lowered herself by a tree as she heard the pounding footfalls of a giant samurai in shiny green and gold armor approaching. She heard him smashing bushes and trees with his kanabo as he searched for her in the shadows. She knew without seeing him that she was being hunted by the samurai that had been corrupted and turned into a demon by the Black Mist Serpent.<br><br>Her sister had told her many tales about this samurai. How he had once been a man of honor and conviction. How he had hunted and executed corrupt merchants and false samurai. How peasants and villagers began calling him a demon because of his savage methods. And how he had ultimately been turned into the very thing he hated most, the very thing the stories depicted him as\u2014<br><br>The Oni Samurai.<br><br>The very same Oni her sister savagely battled long ago when they had been caught in the mist. She had escaped, her sister hadn\u2019t and now all she wanted to do was take down this demon and make him tell her where she was.<br><br>But Saku knew better than to lose herself in the past. She pushed the memory of her sister out of her thoughts and instantly found her focus. She looked through a gap in the trees toward the wharf, where she saw orange specs of light against the wall of darkness that was the sea. She could make it. She could outrun him to a place where he could not follow.<br><br>Looking over her shoulder, Saku saw the giant samurai only ten paces away. He was decked in shiny gold and green armor, and carried around his back a massive leather bag dripping, thick blood at the bottom. A few heads jutted out of the bag and clouds of buzzing flies surrounded him.<br><br>The Oni searched the trees and bramble and was now only seven paces away. Unexpectedly, something jerked away from a bush and he launched at the creature and smashed it with his kanabo, losing his bag in the attack. The bag fell and dozens of heads rolled toward her.<br><br>One head stopped at her feet and stared at her with wide open eyes.<br><br>Saku gasped as she suddenly realized she was staring at her own face. She fixed her gaze at the other heads in the mist and thought that they all seemed to resemble her, as though this demon samurai had already decapitated her countless times before.<br><br>None of it made sense.<br><br>Impossible, she thought. It cannot be. And yet\u2026 it is\u2026 Have I fallen to the demon before? Are there others like me in the demon world that made him? But look\u2026 a scar!<br><br>Saku observed the head at her feet and noticed a long scar on the side of her face. She instinctively felt her own cheek where the scar should have been. It was proof that this was someone else, though she could not deny the resemblance was uncanny.<br><br>Saku swatted flies and reached for the head to get a closer look, but then she suddenly froze when she heard a terrifying roar not five paces behind her. In one fluid motion she dove into a thicket as the kanabo missed its mark. Without a moment to spare, she scrambled to her feet and turned just in time to see a gore-covered kanabo with the crushed head of a rabbit coming down on her with devastating speed.<br><br>Quickly, she sidestepped and withdrew her sword. An instant later she slashed off the demon\u2019s arm with a roar of her own. But knowing the arm would grow back in the mist, she turned and charged away, desperately running for the beach. She had downed the demon before, but somehow it always managed to rise unscathed to continue the hunt.<br><br>There was no defeating the demon.<br><br>There was only one option: escape.<br><br>As she rushed through the woods, she turned back to see the demon chasing after her. She pushed herself to run faster and faster, and just as the demon lunged at her again, she dove out of the mist through a break in the trees to a place he could not follow.<br><br>The demon samurai stopped suddenly and watched her closely.<br><br>Saku clambered to her feet, brushing off sand, seaweed and salt. She turned to face the edge of the woods where she saw red glowing eyes fade into the night. Then she heard the crunch of rocks behind her followed by a clicking sound. She turned slowly to face the barrel of a musket pistol glinting in the moonlight.",

He inched closer to her with a smile, but she did not move nor give him the satisfaction of flinching. She met his gaze and edged back slightly. Then she stared off in the distance where she could see shadows moving about a cluster of abandoned homes near the wharf. The small village had been abandoned, no doubt, due to its proximity to the woods and the creatures that lurked within the mist.<br><br>The man cleared his throat and placed the barrel inches from her face.<br><br>Saku stared into his eyes without fear or concern. She looked down at his sandals and back to his eyes. \u201cMove!\u201d he ordered, his ignorant smile widening. \u201cI know who\u2014\u201d<br><br>A sudden flash of moonlight and his head toppled off his shoulders before he could finish his sentence.<br><br>Saku watched the headless body spray warm blood into the cool night as it jerked left and right and finally collapsed into a mound of shells and seaweed, startling a nervous crab that instantly scuttled away into the gloom of night.<br><br>Saku gripped her sword and patiently picked her way through the jagged rock formations to reach the small village where Black Serpent brutes guarded the area against anyone who might try to interfere with their dark rituals and secret trade negotiations.<br><br>She moved silently through the shadows, following the edge of a home. She froze when she heard footsteps approaching. She slowly placed her back against the wall and waited. She peeked around the corner and saw two thugs telling stories about the demon samurai.<br><br>She crouched slightly, then, like a mighty tigress, she leaped into the air and thrust her sword through the two heads. They jerked violently then collapsed when she pulled her sword from their skulls.<br><br>She took a moment to survey the area, then made her way noiselessly to the wharf where three thugs laughed and made jokes about the strange red alcohol the foreigners had shared with them.<br><br>She held her sword firm, and she started toward them, practically gliding with quick, smooth steps. Just as one brute turned to meet her focused gaze she lunged with blinding speed and\u2014<br><br>Three headless bodies suddenly staggered stupidly in the dark and collapsed into each other with arterial blood spraying darkness against the bright light of the moon.<br><br>Wiping warm blood off her face, she climbed a series of crates, moved past a clump of fishing nets, and crouched by the gangplank. She listened carefully for movement and heard steps just above in the ship.<br><br>When the footsteps receded to silence, she moved stealthily up the gangplank and halted, scanning the ship, spotting one thug sitting crossed-legged on a crate. Beside him were several other crates bearing the VOC logo and name of the Dutch East India Company.<br><br>Carefully, Saku embarked on the ship and moved toward the brute. But just as she prepared to pounce, she heard a click, followed by a high-pitched wheeling sound. It took her less than a moment to understand she had been lured into a trap\u2014less than a moment too late.<br><br>Before Saku had time to react, she felt the heaviness of a net collapse over her as dozens of thugs surrounded her with dirty looks and curses. She then watched the sitting thug, the leader of the group, turn to face her.<br><br>The leader smiled, stood briskly, and laughed. \u201cWe thought you might show up?\u201d he said as he approached her. He made a quick wave with his hand, and the thugs instantly trained musket pistols on her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quite busy interfering with our good work.\u201d<br><br>She didn\u2019t respond, but she pushed and pulled against the net to gauge its strength. She glared at him as she realized this was no chance ambush. The Black Serpent Society had been tracking her and had somehow managed to trap her. The leader shook his head at her.<br><br>\u201cYour clan is destroyed. Your weapon is irrelevant and outdated. You\u2019re outnumbered and trapped and still you think you can do the impossible.\u201d<br><br>This will be difficult, she thought. But not impossible. I\u2019ve been in worse situations and survived.<br><br>Saku inched closer to the leader as he smiled at her. She believed his reluctance to shoot her was evidence that they wanted her alive for one of their rituals.<br><br>The leader motioned to all the thugs and laughed, again.<br><br>Saku gritted her teeth and studied the thugs as they slowly closed in on her from every direction. She looked into the leader\u2019s thieving dark eyes and saw all the lies and treachery of the Black Serpent Society. Then, looking beyond his eyes, she visualized herself triumphing against her enemy, leaping from thug to thug, cutting them down with her sword like weeds.<br><br>Suddenly, the leader barked orders, snapping her back to reality. The thugs inched closer to her with hideous smiles and wide, nervous eyes.<br><br>\u201cSurrender willingly,\u201d the leader said flatly. \u201cAnd we will reunite you with your clan\u2014as misguided as they may have been.\u201d<br><br>Saku understood his meaning.<br><br>He believed their rituals would open a doorway into the nameless realm where they were supposedly trapped and cursed to live out an endless cycle of life and death for reasons beyond comprehension.<br><br>Saku didn\u2019t know what to believe. What she did know was that she wouldn\u2019t allow these thugs the satisfaction of serving her on a sacrificial platter to the darkness they served and she had promised to destroy. She had made an oath long ago as a member of the Red Crown Clan to cleanse the world of the reeking corruption that was the Black Serpent Society, and she planned to honor that oath.<br><br>With the strength and power of her ancestors coursing through her veins, Saku instantly rushed forward, her hand thrusting through the net. Powerful fingers grabbed the leader by the scruff of his kimono and pulled him in. Then, using him as a human shield, she whirled as pistols fired and balls ripped through his belly, chest and skull.<br><br>Through the rising smoke from the pistols, Saku could see the thugs trying to reload. Without a moment to lose, she tossed her busted and shredded shield to the ground, and, with difficulty, she sliced through the net with her sword. A moment later, she was a hurricane of death and destruction, leaping from thug to thug as her hissing blade painted the deck red.<br><br>The thugs didn\u2019t know what to do. They were too stunned to react. It was like fighting a ghost, a monstrous shadow, a formless mist with swords for claws. Their futile attempts to parry her attacks with pistols met empty air as limbs fell and heads rolled.<br><br>It was a horrible nightmare, as if by some strange, ironic twist of fate the Redcrane actually drew her power from the black mist serpent so that she was somehow a servant of the very darkness she had sworn to eliminate.<br><br>When the last thug fell with a gasp, Saku found herself surrounded by blood and carnage. She took in the stench of gunpowder as her gaze slowly lowered to a thug groveling like a maggot. She had sliced his legs at the knees and he was crawling away with nervous elbows that slipped with every move in the growing pool of blood.<br><br>Wiping the gore off her face and kimono, she blocked his path and crouched to face him. The thug looked up at her with widening eyes. A bleat of terror rose from his throat that rose to a shrill pitch as she raised her sword and ended his service to the Black Serpent Society.<br><br>Saku rose slowly, and searching the ship, spotted a cluster of oil lamps glowing and flickering atop a crate. With focused determination, she picked her way through the bodies and kicked the crate, sending the oil lamps scattering to the wooden deck below.<br><br>The lamps spat liquid fire and set the deck and lifeboat ablaze. Then, walking away from the burning ship, Saku considered everything she had just experienced.<br><br>Trapped. How did they know she was coming for them? How could she have taken the bait? How had she been lured so easily?<br><br>Enough. Warriors do not waste time with what ifs and what they should have or could have done. What matters now is the present and taking the next right step.<br><br>Where to now?<br><br>She couldn\u2019t think straight.<br><br>Despite all her training, a flame of anger burst in Saku for her careless mistake. Yet, she repressed her frustration and knew there was no use for it. Anger would only cloud her judgment and waste her time. She needed to keep her composure because\u2014<br><br>Her friends and family could not have perished in vain. Because she was the last of her clan. Because the Black Serpent Society had to be stopped. Because she the hope of all those who believed she would end the darkness that was upon their land. Because she was\u2014<br><br>The Redcrane.",

                        "text": "It was a book club, and they were arguing over the latest Edwin Cain novel along with the interview the author had given where he discussed a concept he had called Dejavuism. He put forward the theory that our brains are biological, quantum computers with vast networking abilities beyond our current understanding of physics. Cain believed that our quantum brains could connect to other beings with similar frequencies within the multiverse as though they were inter-dimensional cellphones. The club members, who discussed these theories and how they sometimes felt their inner voice was another version of themselves advising them from another time or place, began telling stories about instincts, gut feelings, and deja-vu experiences that felt all too real. There was one skeptic who scoffed at the idea of the multiverse. He thought the idea was ridiculous comic book nonsense, and he laughed at the very notion that our brains were interconnected, multidimensional computers that received or projected ideas from the ether.<br><br>One woman exclaimed:<br><br>\u201cIt could be true. Such a theory would help us understand why ideas seem to come to us as a group, or why so many similar ideas seem to bubble up all over the world at pretty much the same time. Who\u2019s to say we aren\u2019t all tapping into the same stream of ideas.\u201d<br><br>The skeptic answered:<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s just coincidence. That\u2019s all it is when a bunch of people from different places come up with similar ideas. And coincidence has nothing to do with the multiverse or other versions of ourselves in the universe.\u201d<br><br>Another man shook his head and said:<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t really agree. There\u2019s shit out there we just don\u2019t understand, and I recently read the idea for Wi-Fi and cellphones came from a bunch of scientists trying to understand a gland in our brain. A gland that\u2019s bioluminescent and seems to be searching for signals. Granted this could be online misinformation, but what is true, and what many cultures believe is that our artists can tap into things not of this world. What I found interesting was how Cain said these visions that artists receive are only accessible to those who experience trauma when they\u2019re young, those who have been bullied, abused, exiled\u2026 those who have learned to shut out their reality for self-protection in order to fully experience other realities.\u201d<br><br>A woman added:<br><br>\u201cThe door to the physical world closes, the door to another world opens.\u201d<br><br>The skeptic laughed and was just about to speak when another woman, an aspiring storyteller, interrupted him and said:<br><br>\u201cI get visions and dreams about the same place all the time. One of my recurring dreams is of Romulus and how he is taken up by a massive black storm cloud and brought to this dark realm where he\u2019s chased by a hideous creature\u2026 a monster that could not possibly exist. What\u2019s strange is he\u2019s not alone. He\u2019s not the only being hunted. He\u2019s with a biker and two other Scottish men who at first I thought were sailors, but then I had this other dream that showed me that they were, in fact, lighthouse keepers. I did some research and I could swear by the pictures that the biker I was seeing was Yui Kimura, the one who disappeared a few years ago.\u201d<br><br>The skeptic laughed and said:<br><br>\u201cSo what your saying is the Emperor of Rome wasn\u2019t assassinated by his generals but is somehow stuck in some kind of demented world with Yuri Kimura and two lighthouse keepers. This, you somehow believe, is real. Romulus and Yui are running from a monster as we sip coffee and tea in our cozy chairs and talk books and authors. This is what you\u2019re putting forward as something possible? Something reasonable for all of us to believe?\u201d<br><br>A woman said:<br><br>\u201cIt sounds a bit out there. But maybe there are things in the cosmos that are beyond reason or science.\u201d<br><br>Another woman beamed at the aspiring storyteller and said:<br><br>\u201cReal or not, you should write a story for your blog or even for your next performance. I think it would be a lot of fun, even if it does require a little suspension of disbelief.\u201d<br><br>The aspiring storyteller smiled and answered:<br><br>\u201cActually, I have a draft I\u2019ve been working on, which I wanted to share with the group before I posted it. I\u2019m still not sure if it\u2019s a story I can perform because it\u2019s a bit complicated and messy, but maybe you can help me find ways to energize and simplify it.\u201d<br><br>Everyone nodded enthusiastically, except for the skeptic who rolled his eyes.<br><br>The storyteller pulled out a coffee stained notebook and opened it to a story that she still hadn\u2019t titled. She took a deep, calming breath and began:<br><br>\u201cThis story doesn\u2019t have a title but I\u2019m thinking of calling it The Tragedy of Cliff and Alex, who were real people and who disappeared before most of us were born. Now, I\u2019m not one to believe in conspiracy theories or urban legends but their story, which I acquired through extensive interviews and research opened my mind to the possibility that there is more to our lives than that which can be seen or proven.\u201d<br><br>The skeptic quipped:<br><br>\u201cWell, that\u2019s convenient, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br><br>The storyteller ignored his comment and continued:<br><br>\u201cLove, for example, exists and ceases to exist just as soon as we indulge in proofs and evidence. As soon as there is doubt\u2026 as soon as there is a need for proof\u2026 love is dead. And yet, we know love is a real. And we know\u2014don\u2019t we\u2014that love is quite unreasonable. It\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s maddening. And we hate that we can\u2019t define it. Love exists, and it doesn\u2019t need to be proven in any way, shape or form for it to be real\u2014\u201d the storyteller made an exaggerated gesture to grab something in the empty air\u2014\u201dAnd yet, just as soon as you try to grasp it\u2014it tatters at the touch.<br><br>\u201cCliff Barra always loved horror movies. He started making scary movies when his father bought him his first Super 8 camera. And so it comes to no surprise that he grew up to be a famous director who translated his favorite gothic novels and horror stories to the silver screen. It\u2019s also no surprise that when he met Alex Damaro, an equally famous art director known for his brilliant and visionary production sets and costume designs, that they were instantly smitten with one another. Together, it`s safe to say, they produced some of the scariest and most iconic films to date. But all this changed when Alex suddenly disappeared while on set in a rolling cloud of black fog the crew insisted they had not designed.<br><br>\u201cFrom that point on, the movies stopped. A great heaviness came over Cliff as he found himself confronted by the horror that he would never see Alex again. He turned his back on his friends, his career, his life, and he became possessed by an obsession to find out what had happened to Alex. Investigations into this strange fog led him to a group of people searching for missing loved ones. With this group he learned about the existence of secret cults and societies that understood the black fog and the strange realm from which it came. He dug deeper and deeper, discovering his old movie set wasn\u2019t haunted as everyone said it was\u2026 but was\u2026 a kind of doorway to another realm. So he returned to the haunted movie set where Alex disappeared and waited\u2026 and waited\u2026 He waited for days until finally he heard Alex\u2019s laughter, and with the laughter came the fog. And the fog rolled in and carried him away.<br><br>\u201cAnd so, Cliff ended up in another world that defied his wildest nightmares. He followed Alex\u2019s voice through a darkness that had never known the light of day. At last, he came upon a forest of wooden stakes bearing skewered heads. He picked his way through the stakes, inspecting each head. The scene reminded him of one of the first films he had made as a teenager. He soon came to one head that resembled an old producer friend of his. Suddenly, the eyes sprang open, and Cliff started. At once, all the heads came alive, taunting and ridiculing him like he had been ridiculed as a child for his passions and hobbies.<br><br>\"But Cliff stayed the course despite the insults and the taunts that he would never see Alex again. One head of the thousands shouted louder than the rest. The head screamed that Alex was being corrupted and that he should turn back before it was too late. Realizing this severed head knew more than the rest, Cliff kicked the stake and caught the head as it toppled off. The head protested and yelled that it had once been a king and it didn\u2019t want to be in the hands of a commoner. And Cliff promised the king he would release him after\u2014and only after\u2014he helped him find Alex.<br><br>\u201cLong story short, the head lead Cliff to the edge of a massive gate that surrounded a town that resembled every production set Alex had ever designed for Cliff. Before he could take in the area, he suddenly heard Alex screaming in the distance. The king warned Cliff not to interfere with the process and explained that Alex was being twisted and tortured into a brutal, murdering monster for reasons they would never understand.<br><br>\u201cBut Cliff couldn\u2019t bear to hear Alex suffer. Every agonizing scream was a dagger in his heart. And so, dropping the head, he climbed over the gate and, unperturbed by the formless creatures moving in the fog, he followed the cries to the top of a castle he recognized from his Frankenstein film. Cliff charged up the winding stairs to the roof, where he found Alex agonizing on a metal table as bolts of lightning struck him every few moments from a thick, black storm cloud. All around him in glass prisons filled with formaldehyde were all the monsters Alex had ever designed since he was a child. Cliff couldn\u2019t believe what he wasn\u2019t seeing. It was as if this living nightmare were all a projection of their combined memories.<br><br>\u201cCliff didn\u2019t even try to understand what was happening or what he was experiencing. Without hesitation, he rushed up to Alex not knowing what to do. In the shadows he spotted an ax on the cobblestone floor and instantly grabbed it. Then, despite the deadly lightning, he pushed through the sizzling and sparking pain to smash the chains that bound Alex to the table. Alex opened his half-conscious eyes with difficulty. He barely recognized Cliff. Alex squinted with charred eyelids and managed to murmur words that made Cliff smile. Then Cliff hefted Alex over his shoulders and charged down the stairs and out into the thickening fog where frantic, formless creatures did all they could to prevent them from escaping.<br><br>\u201cCliff kicked, punched and charged through the fog, smashing through creatures, crows, and claws\u2014everything and anything the world set against him. He remembered the king telling him something about a hatch\u2014the hatch would somehow lead to freedom. Desperately, Cliff searched the ground as he heard a roar followed by a clap of thunder. Pounding steps chased him through the darkness. He didn\u2019t even bother to look back. He rushed forward until he saw it! The glint of metal by a crumbling Gargoyle statue from one of his movies. He ran to the hatch, opened it, and lowered Alex to safety. Then, just as he was about to descend, something sharp like talons clutched his ankles and pulled him screaming into the raging fog!<br><br>\u201cI\u2019d like to say that it all worked out in the end and that they lived happily ever after. But that\u2019s not the truth of this story. The truth is Cliff took Alex\u2019s place at the torturer\u2019s table and was turned into a perfect champion of horror with little or no memory of who he was or how he ended up in this dark realm. And Alex\u2026 well\u2026 He ended up with a group of stranded souls who did whatever they could just to survive. But that\u2019s another story for another time. Suffice to say that love torments all\u2014bringing the best and worst out of us when we least expect it.\u201d<br><br>The storyteller finished and everyone was silent and inward, thinking about what they had sacrificed for love and what they would sacrifice for love. But not the skeptic. No, the skeptic was turning the story over and over in his head searching for issues. At last, he broke the silence, asking:<br><br>\u201cWhat happened to the head? The talking head? Cliff just drops the king\u2019s head and then you never hear about it again. It kind of makes the story incomplete.\u201d<br><br>A woman blurted out:<br><br>\u201cWho cares about the damn head? It\u2019s a love story!\u201d<br><br>The skeptic added:<br><br>\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t think you can use 'tatters' as a verb.\u201d<br><br>The storyteller smiled and politely said:<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m still working the story, and the ideas are still coming to me in my dreams. I\u2019ve been logging them in my notebooks and I\u2019ll re-read the current version more critically to see if I need to do something else with the talking head.\u201d<br><br>Another woman said:<br><br>\u201cAll that horror, and for what? To end up twisted and tortured and turned into some abomination worse than anything he ever filmed. I feel so bad for him.\u201d<br><br>A man said:<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t. Not because I don\u2019t like him as a character, but because that\u2019s just the kinda things we do for love\u2014the horrible and the beautiful, the bitter and the sweet, the euphoria and the madness\u2014\u201d he lost himself in a memory for a moment\u2014\u201dLove twists and torments. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing that dark world can do to anyone that would surpass the torment of not knowing what had happened to a loved one\u2026 or worse\u2026 the regret of knowing what had happened and not doing anything.\u201d<br><br>Another man said:<br><br>\u201cWell, I do hope you publish this story on your blog. I found it heartbreaking and terrifying\u2026 and I guess I\u2019m wondering if you really think this is what happened to the real Cliff and Alex.\u201d<br><br>The storyteller shrugged and closed her notebook as she prepared to leave. She wasn\u2019t sure what she believed anymore.<br><br>The skeptic laughed and said:<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I think. I think the real Cliff and Alex faked their disappearance to get out of the limelight, and they moved far, far away to some gorgeous, exotic island where they\u2019re eating grapes, drinking margaritas, and living happily ever after.\u201d<br><br>The man said:<br><br>\u201cWell, I do hope you\u2019re right and the story is just a story. But if you\u2019re not\u2026 well\u2026 I hope Alex will one day be able to do for Cliff what Cliff did for him.\u201d<br><br>A woman said:<br><br>\u201cIt kind of makes you wonder if the characters we read about in the books are actually real somewhere.\u201d<br><br>Another woman said:<br><br>\u201cA story in this world, reality in another.\u201d<br><br>The storyteller stood, smiled at all the book club members, and excused herself as she had an early shift at the caf\u00e9. Everyone said goodbye, watched her disappear out the door, and then returned to their discussion about Edwin Cain, Dejavuism, and the story they had just heard.",

If she gathers some supplies, perhaps she could reach the coast. Her mother once told her about a dream she had of sailing west across the ocean\u2026 to another world. Perhaps\u2026 Charlotte could leave this hateful place behind and find a new home.<br><br>A branch cracks behind her. She turns around, instinctively holding Victor closer to her chest. Is someone following them?<br><br>She hurries onward, reaching a stony bridge leading to a village on a mossy hill. It is risky to stop at the village, but she needs supplies.<br><br>Charlotte places Victor in the scarf wrapped around her torso. He is too weak to move. Too weak to speak. What the black cloaks did to him in the temple\u2026 changed him. To build his strength back, she needs to get some food and medicine.<br><br>Walking down the village's narrow streets, she reaches the market. Her mother taught her how to get what she needed from a vendor's stall. Distract them and only take what you can carry. Leave before you're noticed. Better to be safe than\u2026 captured.<br><br>She spots a vendor selling herbs and ointments. Medicine is a priority. Charlotte pulls her hood over her face and approaches the stall slowly. Then she waits for an opportunity. When the vendor turns to address another customer, she extends her arm and snatches a few vials.<br><br>Then she spots a pile of fruit at the back of the stall. Risky\u2026 but the sweet smell of ripe apples is enchanting. She glances at the vendor, who is arguing over prices. She crouches and slowly sneaks past him.<br><br>When she reaches for the basket of fruit, she sees what lies under it: cured cheese. She grabs a large piece and shoves it in her bag with a few apples. Then she crouches under the stall and exits the opposite way she came in, leaving the vendor behind.<br><br>Walking hurriedly, she heads down the street, where beggars are kindling rubbish. Despite the stank, the warmth of the flames feels good.<br><br>Suddenly, a heavy hand falls on her shoulder. A towering man with a bow in his hand is staring down at her.<br><br>He smiles menacingly. Hunters were talking about you. You're going to make me a rich man.<br><br>Charlotte kicks the burning pile of garbage and embers spill on the ground, igniting a puddle of wine. Panic spreads faster than flames as several villagers push the beggars who are trying to stamp out the fire.<br><br>Amid the commotion, Charlotte darts off. But the menacing villager snatches her bag, bringing her to a full stop. Panicking, she tears the strap of her bag, and lets its contents spill onto the ground.<br><br>Then she runs at full speed until she reaches the stony bridge. Looking over her shoulder, she sees black smoke billowing from the village. Her stomach churns.<br><br>She once saw a face licked by flames before, cheeks charred like crisp leaves.<br><br>She bites her tongue, trying to repress the memory. She cannot slow down. The villagers could be on her chase.<br><br>She heads into the woods, running until she could no longer smell smoke in the air.",

One of the villagers could be tracking them.<br><br>The river is the safer route since it would leave no trail behind. She steps into the icy water, her oversize boots splashing around. In seconds, her clothes are drenched. When the wind howls, her freezing flesh is set ablaze.<br><br>After several hours of trekking in ice-cold water, she reaches the bottom of a colossal waterfall. The end of the road.<br><br>A plateau lies above, midway between the river and the top of the waterfall. It would make for a difficult climb, but it is possible. If she reaches this plateau, the view would allow her to spot any villager on her trail. She could sleep soundly for the first time in weeks. Looking down at Victor wrapped in her scarf, she sees how pale he looks. They both need their rest.<br><br>Charlotte examines the rock wall surrounding the waterfall, looking for holds and grips in the boulder\u2019s shapes. Then she tightens her scarf around Victor to keep him in place.<br><br>She reaches the cliff and grabs the rock wall. One foot up. Then another. Her arms tire first. She lands her right foot on a protuberant boulder and shifts her weight to relax her muscles. But her heel slides out of her oversize boot. Ignoring her aching arms, she holds onto the cliff, pushing her foot hard against the boulder to force the boot back on. But the boulder shifts under the pressure and comes loose.<br><br>Suddenly, there is nothing but air under her right foot. The boulder tumbles down the cliff along with her boot, plunging into the river. Charlotte\u2019s arms are shaking, and she cannot move. Her fingers are slipping away, one by one. Soon, she will tumble down just like that boulder, and plummet to her death.<br><br>Her breathing becomes ragged. Is this the end?<br><br>She promised Victor she would save him. That one day they would be free. Is this the best she could do? A brutal plunge to their death?<br><br>No, she promised him. She would save him.<br><br>Like she saved maman?<br><br>Charlotte closes her prickling eyes.<br><br>Her last finger is slipping.",

He would tap her shoulder when he needed something. She would hold his hand when she needed his attention. But he is too weak to move. Did he change position when the boulder slipped from under her? Unless\u2026 he is afraid, like her. Maybe he is begging her to save him.<br><br>Charlotte inhales deeply, ignoring her burning arms. She looks up and sees another large boulder to her right, a bit higher. If she lunges, she could reach it. But one false move and she'd land in the river, her head smashed on rocks.<br><br>Her heart is beating wildly, but she is no longer paralyzed. Victor needs her. And she would do anything to save him.<br><br>Digging her nails into the rock wall, Charlotte pulls with all her might and jumps. As she lunges into the air, her heart drops. Then her right foot lands on the higher boulder, which instantly shifts from under her. Terrified, she realizes that she is falling\u2014slowly. Frantically grasping at the wall, she sways her arms, ignoring the sharp rocks tearing and burning her flesh. She closes her eyes as she slides down\u2026 but her right arm finds a grip, bringing her fall to a stop.<br><br>As she holds on, her right foot lands on something solid, and she carefully shifts her weight on it. Her ears are ringing wildly, and her whole body is pressed against the jagged edge of the cliff.<br><br>She looks over her shoulder at Victor. He is cocooned in her scarf, safely.<br><br>Gritting her teeth, Charlotte looks up. The edge of the plateau is about a Toise high. She can do this.<br><br>Charlotte finds a grip for her left arm. Then she pulls. One foot up. Then another.<br><br>On and on for what seems like an eternity.<br><br>All the way up, until she heaves herself over the edge of the plateau, safe.",

But something else happened. For a second, she felt a fleeting relief when contemplating death. And that worries her more than the witch hunters. More than the black cloaks. Because it means that she betrayed Victor. For a moment, she abandoned him. How could she be so cowardly and\u2026 selfish?<br><br>Charlotte presses her hand over his cheek. Ice-cold. Isn't he already gone? No. She couldn't accept that. Losing him would be like laying down in a grave and waiting for soil to smother her. He is her. And she is him. They are one.<br><br>She caresses his pale cheek. I promise you that one day I will take you far away from here. And we will be safe, forever.<br><br>A dark fog coils at her feet as her eyelids become heavy\u2026 Then her eyes close.",

No. Charlotte could see some color on his cheeks. He will get better.<br><br>Getting back on her feet, she examines her surroundings. A forest of evergreen trees stands ahead. And behind her\u2026 she gasps at the view. Tall pines spread west to the shoreline, where dark waves roll against a long bobbling wharf. A harbor of ships heading west.<br><br>To admire the ocean view, Charlotte sits on a bed of soft branches. The sun is setting, spilling blood into the sky. She loosens her scarf, unveiling Victor's face so he can see the boats. She reaches for his hand and grabs it. Ice-cold and limp.<br><br>Charlotte stifles a sob. Everything is fine. Victor is just weakened by their journey. He is still here, with her. Tonight, they will rest, and he will get better.<br><br>Below, large ships are sailing toward the misty horizon, heading further west. They remind her of her mother's dream. When the black cloaks were doing their worse to her, she held onto her mother's words. Charlotte never honestly believed in her mother's dream of sailing west. It was just a beautiful escape. But now it is time to believe. A new dream for a new life.<br><br>Charlotte takes off her hat and wraps it around Victor's hands. Do you know what lies beyond the horizon? Maman told me once. She dreamt of that place, just before she fell sick. She said that there is another world across the ocean. A place with clean rivers and sweet syrup dripping from the trees. A whole other world for us to be free. Do you see that big ship below?<br><br>No answer. Maybe Victor is afraid of dreaming aloud. Some dreams are too delicate to be spoken. But not hers.<br><br>Charlotte brushes off a drop of rain from Victor's pale brow. Everything will be alright, Victor. Just imagine the voyage with me. One day we will sail far away from here. We would sleep in a bed made of ropes, suspended in the air. Each rolling wave would swing our bed from side to side, lulling us to sleep. After a few weeks, we'd reach land. Then, we would find a little house by a creek. In the morning, we would work in a field of golden crops. Each day we'd drink the sun and eat the moon. And no storm would hit us. No men would burn us. No monsters would hurt us. We would live together, free. Our lives would be so normal, you would miss our adventures. Maybe one day, you'll even miss this view\u2026 I promise you. One day we will be free. We'll find a place where we belong. All three of us.<br><br>Her voice breaks. No, they could never be all three again. Their mother is gone. Charlotte looks down at Victor. He is so weak that she could barely see his chest rise.<br><br>No, he is just sick. He needs to rest. She cannot pay her doubts any attention. If she does, she would be the next one to die. And then all three of them would be lost.<br><br>Charlotte closes her eyes. She can almost feel the lush leaves brushing against her legs as she runs through an open field. Victor is laughing in her arms. They are far away from here\u2026",

How is she supposed to take care of her brother when her own mother failed? Charlotte feels so lost without her.<br><br>Looking up, she spots the singing bird: a little sparrow. Images flash through her mind: soft feathers, sharp claws, and a delicate neck in her hands. Blood dripping from her brow as black cloaks beat her, until she wrapped her hands around the sparrow's neck and twisted. They forced her to do monstrous things. But she is no monster.<br><br>Yet she was treated as one. And why? Because Victor is part of her, and she is part of him. They are one, united by blood and bone. They cry double the tears when hurt. They laugh twice over when glad. And even in their darkest moments, they are never alone.<br><br>Side by side, forever. Who else could say the same?

Charlotte can barely see ahead, but the hair on her neck rise\u2014something in the dark watches her.<br><br>She grabs Victor\u2019s hand. Stay calm.<br><br>Holding a large branch in her trembling hands, she walks toward the noise. Wolves are known to hunt far from villages. The further she travels, the higher the risks of running into one.<br><br>While scanning the darkness, she spots a crimson trail on the glittering snow. Further ahead, a large wolf is lying in the snow, its gray fur marred with blood. An arrow is planted in its neck. Hunters must have left it to die.<br><br>The wolf growls as its dark eyes land on her, but seems too weak to move. Then she hears a high-pitch cry. A little white cub hides under the wolf's leg. A dying wolf and its wailing baby, striving to survive.<br><br>Charlotte knows what she must do. And she hates herself for it.<br><br>She leans over and grabs the tiny pup into her hands. The pup snaps at her fingers, but its teeth are too tiny to cause any real pain. Howling, the wolf struggles to get back on its feet, but its legs buckle under its weight and crash into the snow.<br><br>Charlotte ignores the dying wolf's whimpers and digs a hole in the snow, too deep for the pup to climb out of. When Charlotte's own mother screamed in agony, she wished someone would have ended her suffering.<br><br>Charlotte approaches the pup's mother with trembling hands. The wolf growls as she grabs the arrow. In one swift motion, she pulls it out. The wolf howls in anguish and collapses. The cub cries in response, frantically digging itself out of the snow. Charlotte waves her branch at the pup and screams. Run! RUN!<br><br>The pup growls weakly\u2026 then darts off into the night.<br><br>Charlotte's vision blurs as tears mingle with the blood splattered across her face. Is she any better than these hunters? The wolf was too far gone. Such unnecessary pain was cruel. And the hunters would have trapped its pup, if it remained close. A life of captivity with its mother's killers.<br><br>No, Charlotte did them both a mercy. She knows what it's like to be captured by such monsters.",

But it was not entirely true.<br><br>The hunters slept in a wooden shed behind the church, near the woods. The shed was so old and dry, a spark could have sent it blazing. And yet she did nothing but wait for the trial. Then she had to watch her own mother burn to death.<br><br>There had been other missed opportunities to prevent the suffering of innocents.

It's why I'm alone\u2026 so please\u2026<br><br>The drunken fan jabs him in the shoulder. I gotta ask. What did that referee call you that upset you so much?<br><br>You have shit in your ears? Get away!<br><br>The fan jabs David, again. David catches the finger, snaps it against the joint, and takes another sip of donkey piss as the agonized fan falls to his knees, screaming bloody murder.<br><br>Rik quickly gestures to a giant of a man who escorts the drunken fan and his entourage out the door before all hell breaks loose.

Yeah, I can see how much it doesn\u2019t matter.<br><br>David sighs at the sarcasm, and he feels Rik\u2019s eyes on him as he takes a swig, then swallows it all down.

You come in my pub talking about supermodels and exploits you could sell to a smutty magazine, and you're good at it, too. And if I didn\u2019t know you, I'd buy it.<br><br>David winces and turns away.<br><br>So here you are talking about how happy you are while you\u2019re frowning and breaking fingers and ready to take down the first one who talks to you wrong.

You just don\u2019t do that.<br><br>You can believe you\u2019re happy if you want to, but from where I\u2019m standing, you\u2019re the most miserable bastard in Manchester, and I care too much about you to let you think you\u2019ve got me fooled.<br><br>There you go trying to psychoanalyze me again. Probably going to link me to some obscure historical idiot nobody remembers that you read about in one of your dumb books.<br><br>Rik shakes his head. There you go making light of something serious when a friend just wants to know if you're okay.<br><br>There you go being melodramatic when a friend just wants a drink.<br><br>Dave\u2026 I'm sure she's a nice girl, but you know what I say. Screw her. Don\u2019t go. Stand her up and do what you really want to do.<br><br>Stop talking outta your ass.<br><br>Rik leans closer to him. I'm serious, Dave. As serious as the note you keep in your pocket. You know\u2026 the one you read every now and then when you think no one's watching.<br><br>David leans away from him.

He used to write me notes\u2026 quotes\u2026 poetry\u2026 proverbs\u2026 smart-aleck comments he knew would make me laugh.<br><br>We got back together in secret and were together for years until he began asking me to be introduced to my parents.

Smart ass! And everyone toasts to it\u2026 even the Ol\u2019Man.<br><br>King laughs, then stops suddenly. Tristan staggers out with his pint and leaves an old note on the table.

A going away party\u2026 tonight\u2026 He's leaving for New York. Some piano gig. He's leaving with some guy he just met. They hardly know each other a month, and he\u2019s following him to New York.

Because he won't let you break his heart, again.<br><br>David drowns the thoughts by singing louder and louder. Then he stops suddenly when he sees a park he half recognizes. It resembles a park where he and Tristan used to sit on a bench and people-watch all day.<br><br>He enters the gates and for a moment he hears Tristan\u2019s voice singing with him. He stops. Looks around, but doesn\u2019t see anything through thick, slanting sheets of rain.<br><br>David continues through slumbering bushes and sagging flowers under a thick canopy dripping and pit-pattering with rain. He walks ahead until he hears a soft whisper.<br><br>No more bullshit.<br><br>He turns to face\u2014<br><br>Tristan.<br><br>He rubs his puffy eyes and stares with disbelief.<br><br>Tristan laughs. Only you could massacre a line like that.<br><br>It can\u2019t be\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 impossible\u2026<br><br>David narrows his gaze on Tristan\u2019s silhouette. He must have somehow disembarked the plane. Or maybe he never boarded in the first place. He doesn\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening, but he knows better than to overthink his luck.<br><br>David runs to embrace Tristan but just as soon as he touches him, he withers away like a dead flower. With a gasp, David drops to his knees, hopelessly trying to catch the falling petals that melt in his hands and drip through his fingers into a gathering fog.<br><br>He barely has time to register what\u2019s happening when he hears footsteps squelching in the mud and water all around him. He looks up slowly to see every single bully, abuser and shithead he ever took down advancing on him. His gut reaction is to pinch himself, yet nothing happens when he does.<br><br>With a deep sigh of resignation, David rises to his feet, lifts his chin and throws himself into the fray. He tackles and swings and kicks until he\u2019s the last man standing with slithering tendrils of black fog pulling him down into a world of darkness untouched by the light of love.",

In fact, he hadn\u2019t uttered a single word since his return. And as Junius explains how he hopes an old friend would stimulate Tomas, he marches along the grimy London road, leading Talbot to Tomas\u2019 home. Within minutes they approach the entrance of a modest dwelling and Junius knocks hard. A doctor opens the door and greets them both, explaining how Tomas has gone to pieces and that no one can get anything out of him.

He had only disappeared a week and yet there were hundreds of entries. Perhaps, thousands. It made little to no sense. Neither did Junius. He had misjudged the money-man. He was a lot more compassionate than he had anticipated, and he seemed to express genuine sympathy for Tomas.<br><br>Despite being obsessed with profit, he is really quite human.<br><br>It dawns on Talbot that Junius might in fact be two people and that The Company does a strange thing to him, acting almost like a catalyst.

Impressive, really, and secretly, he admires the fact that they do what they want when they want without consequence or fear of tarnishing the reputation of King and country.

Talbot considers the implications of those words over and over again as he prepares his leather satchel with his notebook, tools and vials. He then closes the satchel and wonders who in fact The Company answers to if not the King. Junius had once told him The Company was like a person and was given the same respect as a person. And yet, The Company didn\u2019t seem like a person. It seemed like something else. Something different. Something, perhaps, like a beast\u2026 a beast pretending to be a person. A dark thing unleashed into the world to destroy and plunder and return to its masters with a mouthful of death and a fistful of gold. A part of Talbot hated being a part of this dark thing for the longest time. But over the years he had found a way to rise above his guilt and admire the sheer power and brilliance of what it could do in the world and what it could achieve for its masters without reproach.<br><br>When the beast became a problem, the masters could simply end its life abruptly, burying the beast and all the pain, death and horror it had caused in a forgotten grave. But not the gold. Not the plunder. They, the masters, could keep it all. Keep the gold and the plunder and eventually use it to inject life into a new beast or, perhaps, beasts. The Company may not have been a person, but it was certainly a form of life. And gold was its life-force. Its blood.<br><br>Talbot suddenly feels inspired. Gold is energy. No. Not gold. Currency. Currency is energy. No. Not energy. A variable to direct and control people. To manipulate the fold. Yes. There is something worth exploring in the thought. Something worth pursuing. Something that could help The Company and its masters. He asks himself if there is a way to understand people in reduced terms\u2014in terms of energy and equations.<br><br>Talbot quickly pulls out his notebook and jots down a concept: Fold Energy. He scribbles down an equation, crosses it out, then rewrites another version. He examines the equation, then releases a sigh and crosses it out again. He wonders for a long moment if people could actually be reduced to a chemical equation that could somehow determine output and potential.<br><br>It was a strange idea. Perhaps even an awful idea. And yet this idea had legs\u2014legs like a beast. It was certainly plausible to treat people as a kind of energy that could be contained and controlled except for one variable\u2014the human variable.<br><br>Empathy.<br><br>The strength of currency as a variable to control, manipulate and predict energy flow would be directly proportional to the value people placed on currency in their lives. But\u2026 there had to be ways to remove or reduce the human variable. To somehow turn currency into a collective god, or, in the very least, a demi-god. Something the fold feared, prayed to, and constantly meditated on. One single god to control them all. One single variable to stimulate, shock, and direct Fold Energy.<br><br>Talbot stares at his notebook and laughs to himself. The idea is ludicrous! There are no legs! There\u2019s no present or future world where he or anyone else could experiment on eliminating the human variable. Such a thing not even The Company could get away with. But if it could\u2026<br><br>\u2026If it could\u2026<br><br>...It would be far more powerful and effective at controlling the fold than any King or Empire.<br><br>Talbot scratches out his equations, realizing they are nothing more than highly imaginative scribbles masquerading as science. Even if The Company were granted the ability to experiment on the fold without limits he could not imagine how this intangible human variable could be reduced let alone removed from the equation. All the cultures and communities and diverging beliefs and values would never allow such a god or demi-god to exist.<br><br>Shaking his head at the absurdity of his theory, Talbot closes his notebook, places it in his satchel and prepares for the journey to come.",

A fountain of hot arterial blood sprays the cold darkness as Calder screams in agony.<br><br>Talbot swallows hard as Oswald panics to help the tracker. He moves past the screaming man and stares at the retreating vines with mingled curiosity and disbelief.<br><br>It might be that this other realm is very much conscious. A living realm analyzing and testing them. To what purpose, he isn\u2019t sure. But\u2014<br><br>Screams suddenly interrupt Talbot\u2019s thoughts. He turns on Calder and suppresses an impulse to yell at him. He\u2019s likely in excruciating pain and didn\u2019t mean the interruption. He quickly puts on an expression of concern and kneels by his trembling body, wondering how long a person can live without a leg.<br><br>Oswald cries that they should take him back to camp. But Talbot\u2019s unwilling to compromise his one opportunity to observe and study what no chemist has ever observed or studied before. Yet he doesn\u2019t want to waste time arguing with Oswald. He simply wouldn\u2019t understand. He tells Oswald he needs to dress Calder\u2019s wounds before they can carry him back to camp.<br><br>Oswald nods agreement as Talbot withdraws a bottle of laudanum, his concoction, a mixture more powerful than anything any company has ever produced. He places the bottle to Calder\u2019s lips, tells him the serum will ease the pain, and he proceeds to pour the contents down his trembling mouth.<br><br>Within moments, Calder stops shaking and his eyes roll back as he issues his last breath. Talbot allows a small grin and he suddenly feels the barrel of a pistol at the base of his head.<br><br>What did you do to my friend?<br><br>Talbot closes his eyes and waits for death.",

He examines the round shape, smooth texture and places it in a vial. Then he grabs another vial and begins to catch droplets of this otherworldly fluid, wondering if like the poppy it could open doorways within the mind. A strangled gasp suddenly breaks the almost palpable silence. He searches the small twisted trees and shrubs and soon finds Oswald with his back against a boulder, sucking in quick shallow breaths, covering a wound in his stomach with his hand. He looks up at Talbot.<br><br>Quick, please\u2026 It\u2019s coming back for me.<br><br>Talbot is torn between helping him and moving on.<br><br>What is? What\u2019s coming for you? What did this to you?<br><br>Talbot takes a shuddering breath and kneels beside Oswald, opening his satchel and searching for thread to stitch him up.<br><br>It\u2019s hunting us\u2026 the man-beast. Nothing hurts it\u2026 Nothing\u2026 I shot it, cut it, stabbed it and it continued after me...<br><br>Save your strength.<br><br>I found the others. They\u2019re alive\u2026 this thing\u2026 it's making something with them.<br><br>Talbot retrieves the thread and begins to stich up the gash. He turns to the satchel and his eyes take in the luminous blue fluid he collected from the vines and flowers. He\u2019s not sure what it does, and he knows it will be a while before he does.<br><br>Talbot stares at Oswald. He can\u2019t do it. He shouldn\u2019t do it. And yet, this is an emergency. He must do what he can to help him even if it means taking a chance on an untested serum.<br><br>He almost has no choice.<br><br>He hesitates, then grabs the vial and stares at it. He knows he\u2019s lying to himself. He knows there are other ways to help him. But he also knows The Company hasn\u2019t officially accepted his proposal for human experimentation. Human experimentation could take a long time, a real long time, and he doesn\u2019t have a long time. It might be years before he gets another chance like this. He could administer a drop\u2026 just a drop\u2026 and see what medicinal properties the nectar-like secretion may or may not have.<br><br>The secretion is a gift from another world. Last thing he wants is to spend years staring at the vial collecting dust on a wooden shelf in his laboratory while The Company debates the merits of his proposal. In fact, they\u2019ll be grateful he took the initiative.<br><br>Slowly, he lowers the vial to the wound. He tilts the lip slightly and lets a tiny drop slip out into the sticky wound. He waits for his blood to absorb the secretion and watches ever closely.<br><br>At first nothing seems to happen. Then all at once Oswald\u2019s face twists in horror as his body warps. A fiery blue light burns through him as blue and purple sacks begin to cover his body.<br><br>Talbot stares, amazed. He\u2019s never seen anything like it. It\u2019s incredible. One drop shocked his entire system within a few minutes. The mutation and energy release alone seemed impossible. And yet\u2026 there it was\u2026 right in front of him.<br><br>Oswald screams as one boil after another erupts with purple puss.<br><br>Amazement turns to fear as Talbot stares at the ghastly sight and realizes what he\u2019s done to the cook. His mind searches desperately for ways to help the poor man but there\u2019s nothing he can do. Over the screams he hears Ena\u2019s disembodied voice echoing behind him.<br><br>Talbot, dear, what have you done? What have you done!<br><br>Talbot scrambles back on his heels, then turns and charges through the madness of this impossible world with a maelstrom of conflicting emotions rushing through him.<br><br>What have I done? What have I done!<br><br>Talbot shambles through thick vines and clambers over rocks and corpses blooming with luminous flowers. He tumbles to the ground and tells himself it was for the greater good. That the cook was probably going to die anyway. That he\u2019s doing something important. That he\u2019s searching for chemicals and compounds potent enough to transport people to other worlds at the speed of thought.<br><br>The speed of thought is the only way to travel between worlds, and the doors to these unseen and unknown worlds are within\u2026 and any effort in trying to find those keys far outweigh the life of a cook.<br><br>Desperately, he clambers to his feet and finds himself surrounded by a living mass of black fog. He stares at it intently and his panicking mind calms with amazement as he finds himself staring at tiny cells that undulate together like some sort of vaporous membrane. Then\u2014<br><br>The fog slowly dissipates to reveal a tree covered in thick black leaves.<br><br>Talbot stares at the tree and begins to notice the trunk writhing and realizes it made of people. He realizes in amazement that he has found the missing employees. He begins a slow march toward this tree of death with his eyes wide and his jaw hanging. It\u2019s beautiful and horrific at the same time. It\u2019s\u2026<br><br>Sublime.<br><br>It\u2019s the only word that comes to mind.<br><br>As Talbot approaches the gnarled tree, the black leaves suddenly take flight, revealing themselves to be massive crows. He gazes skyward and watches the crows disappear into the darkness. Then he hears the crunch of stone and quickly lowers his gaze to find himself face to face with the man-beast.<br><br>The creature stares at Talbot with a gaping mouth and glowing blue eyes as though recognizing him. It hesitates and seems conflicted as it peers into his disbelieving eyes. Suddenly\u2014<br><br>The creature shrieks something horrible and vines burst out of its hands and wrap around his chest squeezing the breath out of him until he slowly drifts into nothingness.<br><br>With a gasp, Talbot opens his eyes alone in the desert under a blistering sun with no sense of the passage of time. He remembers pulling himself off the tree. He remembers someone crying out to him for help. He remembers taking samples as everything evaporated before his eyes. Then he remembers walking and collapsing under a scorching white sun, wondering if he was going to suddenly wake up in another world or, perhaps, in an opium den.<br><br>Talbot struggles to sit up as a mirage of men on camels gallop toward him. He looks down to his clenched fist, opening it slowly to reveal a blue and purple flower.",

In a nearby pile of discarded stories I even found comic books inspired by the very same memories. Seems to me that these comics were created by artists and authors in other worlds who somehow dreamed of this maniac and his crimes. True in one world, fiction in another, and, I suppose, vice versa. Makes me wonder if someone in another world is dreaming and writing about us.",

                        "text": "The farmhouse sat at the end of a long, serpentine dirt road in the middle of nowhere. The derelict house at the end of the road had a roof that sagged and a warped, wide-covered deck with birdfeeders that hadn\u2019t been filled in years. The vast cornfields surrounding the farm house were wild and rumpled. A chime dangling from a nearby gnarled tree rang softly in the warm, humid wind as Max Holt, sitting on a hill at a distance, used binoculars to examine the barns, the rusting tractors and an old collapsing outhouse. Just beyond the farm, he noticed a cemetery with gravestones, etched black against the dusk. He sighed, lowered the binoculars and wiped beads of sweat off his brow.<br><br>\u201cSo why exactly am I in Texas?\u201d He asked, adjusting a small device in his ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about this abandoned farm?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not abandoned\u2026 We decoded a name two days ago and tracked him here.\u201d Haddie\u2019s voice emerged through the tiny black, communication device in his ear.<br><br>\u201cWhat do we know about the mark?\u201d<br><br>\u201cTom Smith. Born in Nevada. Worked as a creative manager in the 60s and 70s in South America for several multinational corporations. No citations. No tickets. No fines. Always paid his taxes on time. Perfect record.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSounds like a cover.\u201d<br><br>\u201cGood observation. His real name is Luis Rand. Born in Oakland. Film degree from UCLA. Recruited by the government for a special department. Luis ended up in charge of manufacturing rebellion. Meaning, he produced fictional radio broadcasts in several countries reporting on the victories of rebels that never existed.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhy go through all that trouble?\u201d<br><br>\u201cPeople don\u2019t act if they\u2019ve lost hope.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat year are we talking about?\u201d<br><br>\u201c1950s. Luis created fictional rebel groups to revolt against a government that was trying to do some good for its people. Each broadcast reported a growing rebellion marching on the capital to depose of the president. Usual fare\u2026 lies, terror, propaganda\u2026 fabrications designed to make the rebels seem unbeatable so no one would dare oppose them. The agency created a boogeyman that never existed, and they used that boogeyman to overthrow an elected president trying to do some good for his country.\u201d<br><br>\u201cRight,\u201d Max said. \u201cAnd heard they\u2019re working on a sequel to the original \u2018War of the Worlds.\u2019 Looking forward to that, myself. Heard it\u2019s an epic Five Eyes co-production with no expenses spared.\u201d He chuckled as he scanned the vast empty fields behind the farm. \u201cShould I be looking out for mutilated cows or scorched geometric shapes in cornfields?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot funny, Max. These operations corrupted, destabilized and destroyed entire countries, and Luis has information the Vale wants. You need to get to him before they do.\u201d<br><br>Suddenly, Max heard a rumbling in the distance. His binoculars swiveled to a black SUV thundering down the dirt road, throwing great clouds of dust in the air. \u201cShit, we might be too late. I\u2019ve got an SUV approaching fast.\u201d He hooked his binoculars to his belt and withdrew his pistol. \u201cI\u2019m heading in.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWatch yourself.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAlways.\u201d<br><br><br><br>MAX RUSHED DOWN THE HILL as the SUV came to a stop and three shadowy figures vaulted out. Two agents kicked the front door and charged into the house while the other stood guard outside. As Max approached the entrance he lowered to a stealthy crab-walk. From inside he suddenly heard someone cry out in pain. They had Luis and were preparing to torture him. He had to move fast.<br><br>With a great sense of urgency, Max inched closer to the guard, concealing himself in the shadows. Then, all at once, he sprung up behind him, took him in a chokehold and squeezed until his torso shook and his legs sagged.<br><br>Carefully, Max lowered the unconscious agent to the ground as Luis released another scream. They had begun to interrogate him. He didn\u2019t have much time.<br><br>Max followed the edge of the house to an open window and climbed inside the cluttered home and nearly slipped on a counter covered in grime and dead flies. Stacks of dirty dishes covered the kitchen table. Piles of magazines and books rose from the floor to the ceiling. On the walls were black and white surveillance photos of artists painting murals and protesting various dictators that had been selected and sponsored by the agency.<br><br>Max picked his way into the hallway, moving slowly toward the sound of hard knuckles hitting swollen flesh accompanied by the occasional groan. He froze suddenly when everything stopped and one of the agents spoke. \u201cWhere are the letters? Where are The Crows? Who else knows about them?\u201d<br><br>Luis didn\u2019t answer.<br><br>The punches and groans continued, and so did Max. He inched slowly toward the living room, picking his way around the stacks of boxes and crates, stopping with each step to listen.<br><br>\u201cWhere are the letters?\u201d<br><br>Luis coughed and struggled with every word. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m just an old man who hoards a lot of useless junk from around the world.\u201d<br><br>Max reached the living room and peeked through the open doorway.<br><br>One agent prepared a small bottle of orange serum and held it up to Luis. \u201cI\u2019ll ask my questions, again. Disappoint me and you get a drop of Grime. Disappoint me, again, and we move to a spoonful. Another time, and it\u2019s the bottle. If we\u2019re mistaken, and you\u2019re just an old man who likes to hoard junk from around the world, then you have no idea what Grime will do to you.\u201d<br><br>The agent tilted the bottle and let a drop form at the rim of the bottle and asked, \u201cWhere are the letters? Where are The Crows? Who else knows about them?\u201d<br><br>Luis shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with forces you couldn\u2019t possibly understand.\u201d<br><br>The agent smiled and let a drop of Grime fall into Luis\u2019 busted mouth. Luis struggled to keep his mouth closed, but the drop dissolved into his cuts and swollen lips.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m told a drop of Grime unlocks a doorway to hell,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what a bottle would do. Let\u2019s try, again, and let\u2019s not presume to know what I would and wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d<br><br>Luis scoffed. \u201cYou remind me of myself when I was first at the agency. Do you even know who you\u2019re working for? Who you\u2019re really working for? Not the government. Not even the corporations. That\u2019s what I thought at first when I realized we weren\u2019t working for the government\u2026 I thought we were working for the corporations\u2026 But they\u2019re just tools like the agency for a very dark end.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhere are the letters!\u201d<br><br>The agent filled a spoon with serum and thrust it into his mouth, breaking his four front teeth.<br><br>Luis gagged and coughed and spat blood and saliva. After a long moment he said, \u201cYou know the serum you hold is made from a very peculiar flower that comes from another place. And I don\u2019t mean another country.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhere are The Crows!\u201d<br><br>\u201cYour true masters are into some crazy shit. They are. They don\u2019t just sacrifice people to their ancient god. No. That would be too easy. They go a step beyond. They sacrifice villages, towns and countries, turning them into places of fear. It\u2019s all about the fear\u2026 hate\u2026 anger\u2026\u201d<br><br>Luis nodded.<br><br>\u201cWhat we did in the 50s and 70s was just the beginning. They want to sacrifice the world. They do. They think by turning this world into a living hell they\u2019ll bring forth transcendence.\u201d<br><br>The agent sighed. \u201cYou are a stubborn old mule, aren\u2019t you.\u201d He grabbed his hair, tilted his head back and smashed the bottle into his mouth just as Max sprung from the shadows in one fluid motion, firing two rounds into each surprised face. Then he rushed to Luis and pulled the bottle out of his gaping mouth.<br><br>Luis smiled at Max. \u201cI ain\u2019t getting out of this one. I can already hear the voices\u2026 the horror\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cLuis, stay with me.\u201d<br><br>Luis stared at Max for a long moment. Then he said, \u201cYou\u2019re the ones, they\u2019re after\u2014the wrench in their finely oiled killing machine.\u201d<br><br>Max nodded as the Comms in his ear sounded. \u201cAsk him about what they wanted?\u201d He inched closer to Luis. \u201cWhat do you have that scares them so much?\u201d<br><br>Luis smiled. \u201cWords.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWords?\u201d<br><br>\u201cPoetry. Art. Letters.\u201d Luis began to sob, and Max was sure the serum was beginning to act on his faculties. Then he continued, \u201cI thought I was a patriot, preventing threats to our way of life. Imagine my surprise when I found out the agency is just a tool for a bunch of rich assholes in dark robes. I hurt so many people\u2026 they\u2019re coming for me\u2026 \u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat did they want?\u201d<br><br>Luis struggled against the poison coursing through his veins.<br><br>\u201cWe targeted her because she was connected. She could see things in the other world. She could see their faces and she could paint them in a way no remote viewer ever could. When we tried to own her\u2026 her voice\u2026 her art\u2026 so she wouldn\u2019t expose us\u2026 she still painted\u2026 whatever she wanted.\u201d<br><br>Luis fell silent, and his face tightened.<br><br>\u201cHer mother was the same, and we intercepted her letters to her daughter. We couldn\u2019t let her know her mother was still alive. Both mother and daughter had something between them we couldn\u2019t possibly understand. A variable we had somehow overlooked.\u201d<br><br>Luis groaned and trembled and struggled to calm himself before he continued.<br><br>\u201cWe paid her father to keep a close eye on her and report anything unusual in her art. She could see crows from the other world\u2026 she told her father they were following her, protecting her, and he thought she was crazy.\u201d<br><br>Luis began to breathe heavily.<br><br>\u201cIt was all there in her collection\u2026The Crows\u2026 a blueprint of how they planned to sacrifice the entire world to their ancient god. I\u2019ve seen the paintings, and I still don\u2019t get it. I hate what we did to that poor girl and her brother. At least the mother\u2026 got away\u2026\u201d<br><br>Luis trailed away. He collected his thoughts and took in a deep breath.<br><br>\u201cThe girl nearly got away too. She ran, and she started a collective of artists, a rebellion we didn\u2019t control, and they painted and wrote poetry against the corruption\u2014against the darkness.\u201d<br><br>Luis shook his head, almost in disbelief.<br><br>\u201cThey published a book of poetry along with an underground magazine. We had to find every single one of those books and periodicals and burn them.\u201d<br><br>Luis began to stammer.<br><br>\u201cHer mistake was going to her father\u2026 for all the things she had seen she did not see him.\u201d<br><br>Luis lost himself for a moment. Tears formed in his eyes and slowly slipped down his face as he continued.<br><br>\u201cShe was just an experiment and she ended up turning against us. She was the key, the leader, the inspiration for them and for me\u2026\u201d<br><br>His eyes widened as though he saw something horrible behind Max. He closed his eyes and when he opened them again he continued with difficulty.<br><br>\u201cWhat we did to them\u2026 I will never forgive myself for.\u201d<br><br>\u201cDo you have the letters?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThey\u2019re coming for me! I can hear them!\u201d<br><br>\u201cDo you have the paintings!\u201d<br><br>Luis started, then nodded as he struggled for every breath.<br><br>Max realized he didn\u2019t have much time. \u201cAre they in the house?\u201d he asked, leaning closer to Luis. But Luis didn\u2019t answer. He tried to speak with difficultly, whispering:<br><br>\u201c15\u2026 13\u2026\u201d<br><br>He repeated the numbers again, then suddenly shrieked and thrashed in the chair. Max tried to rip the tape off his arms as he jerked about, making the chair thump against the creaking floors.<br><br>When Max finally freed him, Luis jackknifed to his feet, charged past him and dove straight through the window. Bleeding from multiple lacerations, he crawled toward the cemetery before his mouth froze in a hideous scream of terror.<br><br><br><br>OUTSIDE IN THE GROWING DARKNESS, Max knelt beside Luis checking for a pulse but didn\u2019t find any. Luis' eyes were wide and his hand extended out toward the cemetery. \u201cNothing you could have done for him,\u201d Haddie\u2019s voice sounded in his ears. Max stared at the dead man\u2019s hands, then the cemetery where he saw gravestones in the moonlight.<br><br>\u201c15\u2026 13\u2026 It could be a safety deposit box.\u201d Haddie observed.<br><br>Max nodded. \u201cYeah, it could be.\u201d He narrowed his eyes on the cemetery. The trail of blood Luis left on the ground was like an arrow pointing to a gravestone. \u201cHold on, I got a hunch.\u201d<br><br>Max stood and proceeded toward the cemetery.<br><br>\u201cYou need to be careful. There could be more agents on their way.\u201d<br><br>\u201cGovernment agents I can handle. It\u2019s the other shit I\u2019m worried about.\u201d<br><br><br><br>MAX FOUND A BURIAL PLOT MARKED 1513 IN THE SMALL CEMETERY, and using a shovel he had found in a barn, he dug deep into the ground until he hit a coffin. He jumped down into the hole and brushed the dirt off the lid with his blistered hands. Then he heaved the rotten lid open to find a thick lining of black plastic. As he ripped the plastic apart, the scent of wet earth, paint and burnt wood hit him like slap in the face. But within moments he found himself staring at sketches, books, envelopes, statuettes and paintings from different times and origins. \u201cJackpot!\u201d he said, and activated his cellphone camera to send a live stream to Haddie who was sitting safely in the back of a cramped bookstore in New York City.<br><br>\u201cMora,\u201d Haddie said as she observed the paintings. \u201cWe\u2019ve sensed she was \u2018marked\u2019 like the others but could never prove it. She was clearly connected\u2026\u201d Her voice trailed away pensively as he held the cellphone above a painting of a medieval lord surrounded by stacks of bodies in a crumbling castle. \u201cLooks like another artist\u2026 also seeing into the other realm\u2026\u201d<br><br>Max scanned the paintings, then moved on to a copy of a book titled, \u2018Poets Against the Darkness.\u2019 From within the book he pulled out an envelope with \u2018WSFM\u2019 written on it. \u201cWhat does WSFM stand for?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWeird Science and Freakin' Magic department.\u201d<br><br>Max chuckled. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br><br>\u201cTrue story\u2026 you\u2019re starting to lag\u2014\u201d<br><br>Max looked up and to his horror he noticed a thick, unnatural fog creeping over the open grave. \u201cShit!\u201d he said with dawning realization. \u201cI think I\u2019m in a Bleed. I think that\u2019s why Luis hid the artifacts here.\u201d<br><br>But Haddie didn\u2019t respond. A high pitch whine sounded in his ear and he instantly pulled off the earpiece. As he thrust his comms into his pocket, he saw crows circling above and felt his entire body suddenly prickle with needles. His body was reacting to another vibration as he shifted in and out of another dimension. As he tried to gather himself, he heard a twig snap above. He looked up to see a tall woman made of darkness standing by the grave.<br><br>Max quickly hid inside the coffin, pulling the wooden lid over. He stared through a crack in the wood at the dark apparition looming above him. It stared down at the coffin with cold black eyes and black blood like ink dripping down from its fingers. A crow flew down into the grave, landing on the coffin, pecking nervously at the lid, giving away his position.<br><br>Max closed his eyes and waited to be dragged away to this other world. But the crow disappeared and the apparition drifted away from the grave. Max quietly slipped out of the coffin and climbed out of the grave, ascending into a world of fog. He could hear the crows circling above but couldn\u2019t see them. As he ran, he heard the sound of his heart thumping against his chest, and then he heard footsteps. Behind him. Growing faster. Louder.<br><br>Max glanced over his shoulder but saw only a mass of fog. He didn\u2019t wait for whatever lurked in the darkness to snatch him. He charged through the cemetery, jumped over the fence and stumbled miserably to the ground. Then he closed his eyes and lost consciousness as a high-pitched whine filled his ear.<br><br>When at last he opened his eyes, it was morning and beams of golden sunlight poured through the cracks of a door illuminating the darkness and warming his face. He had no recollection of what had transpired, only vague flashbacks of dragging himself over the ground while unnatural and incomprehensible things moved around him.<br><br>He remembered the crows, the woman with the black eyes, and the shrieks and screams that rent the night. He remembered seeing the outhouse and crawling through a layer of fog. He remembered opening the creaking, red door and hiding inside. Everything else was a blur.<br><br>Covered in dirt and filth, he stepped out into the harsh, white sunlight. He grabbed his phone and called Haddie. A moment later her face appeared on the small screen.<br><br>\u201cThought we lost you there.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been run over by a truck\u2026 but I\u2019m still here\u2026\u201d Max turned round and round, staring at the old farm. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou were out the whole night.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYeah\u2026 well\u2026 It felt like an eternity.\u201d",

                        "text": "Saku spent the day piling the decomposing bodies she had discovered in the remote mountain village. Mothers. Fathers. Brothers. Sisters. Children. All killed in a ritualistic manner. And as night descended, she set the victims of the Black Serpent Society ablaze. The flames rose violently and shot burning red embers into the black abyss above. As the fire waved and crackled, Saku watched the flames devour flesh and tried not to think of the suffering the Society had put the village through. One of their members was \u2018Becoming\u2019 and the Becoming ceremony was a rite of passage. The member would drink tea brewed from the purple petals of a flower they harvested from another world, and this tea either killed them or brought them a nightmare from this other world that they would have to recreate in this one. She had witnessed three of these nightmares before. Horrifying monuments made out of villagers who had been hunted down like game and tortured and restructured into a human offering. She didn\u2019t know what horrors these snakes had seen in the other world, but whatever they had seen could not have been more horrific and brutal than what they created in this world.<br><br>Reflecting on the offerings Saku had seen in the past, she expected she would find a similar offering not too far from the village. And so, preparing for the worst, she grabbed a branch on the ground and lit a torch from the burning pyre. Carefully, she made her way into the surrounding woods.<br><br>It wasn\u2019t long before Saku found a pile of clothing and a trail of gore and petals. She followed the trail to a mound of beautiful flowers growing from the hacked bodies of villagers. With a sigh, she examined the area, the flickering torchlight lighting the way. Within moments, she realized the area had been hacked and cleared so that it resembled a kind of maze. The villagers had been hunted and captured in this maze that was meant to resemble a snake\u2019s nightmare.<br><br>That\u2019s what she called members of the Society.<br><br>Snakes.<br><br>There was nothing human about them. People had warmth and empathy, and these cultists lacked both and likely had cold blood running through their veins. And Saku knew the creator of this maze and offering might still be around, embedded in its offering to the Black Serpent, symbolically shedding its human skin.<br><br>Saku turned back to the offering and held her breath as she searched the ghastly faces of the dead for signs of life. As she searched for the snake in this garden of death, she suddenly heard the crackle of undergrowth behind her. Instinctively, Saku ducked as a thick ax whirred over her head and cut through flowers and a bloated torso. Stepping back, she dropped the torch and turned to face a snake in a demon mask shrieking at her. The snake withdrew the ax attacked wildly.<br><br>With short, quick steps, Saku evaded savage blows. Then she withdrew her gleaming sword and in one fluid motion, she decapitated the snake and watched the headless torso stagger left and right as a fountain of warm blood sprayed the ground and trees. The torso collapsed and became one with the offering as the head rolled away and finally stopped at the base of a tree.<br><br>Saku walked over to the head, picked it up, and removed the mask to reveal a young woman with wide, unblinking eyes. Feeling sad for this woman who had been charmed, groomed and corrupted by the Society, she carried the head to the offering where she placed it next to the torso.<br><br>Gently, Saku picked up the flickering torch from the ground and set the offering on fire. The burning stack of bodies reflected bright orange in her eyes as she remembered her clan and wondered if she would ever stop the Society from corrupting and destroying her beloved country.",

But when no hawk burst from the trees after a few minutes, they continued up the trail, reminiscing about the first time they had met on the trail.

His father told the best horror stories, and those stories always gave him what no other story could: a greater appreciation for his life. The vivid words. The creepy sounds. The perfectly designed dramatic pauses that made him suddenly conscious of the pounding heartbeat in his ears. Wanting the story to continue and stop at the same time. Uncomfortable. Unsettled. Yet, captivated. And then\u2014<br><br>The climax!<br><br>And the rush of adrenaline that followed.<br><br>But the adrenaline wasn\u2019t what he enjoyed the most. No. It was something else. It was\u2026 he wasn\u2019t sure what it was\u2026 He didn\u2019t want to save the world, or win the Olympics, or travel to a foreign country to see something new and exotic. He just wanted the horror to end. He wanted his life back.<br><br>The scarier the story the more he appreciated his life. And to know that his father\u2019s stories were true doubled that feeling. Doubled the spell the story had on him. The truth of those stories made them far more potent than those dark fantasies that came from the imagination. His father\u2019s stories were real and that made them scarier.<br><br>Much scarier.<br><br>His father wanted him to design stories just like he did. Follow his path. Hunt and murder human beings in the shadows.<br><br>And he did.<br><br>Just not in the way his father had intended.<br><br>And now Danny designs better stories. Much better stories. Better because of the setting. Because they could happen anywhere, unlike his father\u2019s stories which took place in what experts called \u2018abnormal circumstances\u2019 where scary and gruesome stories were expected.<br><br>His settings made the horror all the more unique.<br><br>All the more unexpected.<br><br>And now, as Danny sits on his couch in his air-conditioned studio apartment, he feels the sudden need to design another story.

He laughs to himself as he watches John exit the community college where he teaches anthropology. He took a class in anthropology once. And he remembers the heated debates with his teacher who tried to make him believe in this ridiculous theory of the homo sapiens\u2014that humanity was intrinsically curious and intelligent species that evolved toward peace and prosperity with its many civilizations and achievements.<br><br>Danny argued the opposite. He argued humans were intrinsic killers\u2014killers that evolved to enslave, acquire, destroy and eventually self-destruct. That the achievements and the civilizations were tools for blood. That the mask of civilization was a fa\u00e7ade, a farce, an elaborate design to hide the true face of humanity\u2014the bloody face of horror, as he often liked to call it. The bloody face of horror always found a way to break through the mask. Always. The more we contained and hid the truth, the stronger and more creative it got in breaking free. As if it had a life of its own. A need of its own.<br><br>They were fun debates. His teacher cited the golden age of prosperity at the turn of the century and Danny countered with World War One. His teacher talked about the advent of electricity, and Danny talked about the electric chair and the electrocution of an elephant at a festival. His teacher raved about tractors and the Green Revolution, and he raved about tanks and Agent Orange. His teacher pointed to the airplane and all the great opportunities flight brought humanity. And Danny pointed to the bombs. And that was the end of the argument.<br><br>All that curiosity and inventiveness paid for in blood and used to shed even more blood.<br><br>His teacher called these extreme situations. Abnormal situations. Misuse of human ingenuity. But Danny wasn\u2019t convinced. Danny claimed there were more abnormal than normal situations in any given century including the twentieth century.<br><br>Especially the twentieth century.<br><br>The twentieth century saw great advances in knowledge and technology but not wisdom.<br><br>Never wisdom.<br><br>Wisdom always came last if it came at all.<br><br>Ten years of blood for every day of peace.

                        "text": "10:04 PM. Tom, Pete and Bradley lock up a minute later than usual. Danny stands in the shadows away from the bright street lights, observing them through a glass door. When they disappear into the staff room, he puts on his beloved, bone-white mask and prepares for his first walk through of the setting. He\u2019ll walk through the Coliseum at least two more times before he finalizes the design, allowing his ideas to work themselves out.<br><br>Time to incubate is the secret to any great design.<br><br>And it\u2019s the phase he knows not to rush. It\u2019s the most important phase. Everything else is just execution.<br><br>Danny laughs at his pun as he glides through the darkness toward the exit door. How often did he have issues with his design only to be struck by inspiration in the middle of the night? He knows now that if he has any creative blocks he just has to sleep on it. There\u2019s something about sleep that polishes every design.<br><br>Now Danny opens the exit door which he tinkered with earlier in the day. Stealthily, he enters the arcade, gliding past the small concessions booth toward the growing sound of a debate. He hides near the staff room where he hears the loud and obnoxious stooges argue over horror movies and killers.<br><br>Danny suddenly feels the blood rushing up his neck as they get everything wrong. Idiots poking fun at something they don\u2019t understand, or, at best, think they understand. Idiots criticizing some of the greatest designs and spewing vitriol about how they could have done better. So much better. Tom even suggests that they should work together to create a design of their own. Give Roseville something to be really scared of.<br><br>Danny clenches a fist and wants to rush inside the staff room and rip their heads off. He takes a moment to calm himself. In a week or so he\u2019ll have his moment with these arrogant idiots. The intellectual masturbation of those who shout from the sidelines and wonder what it\u2019s like to actually step into the ring. They exist in every creative field. He knows that, and laughs at himself for actually letting them get in his head. He\u2019d actually love to see the stooges attempt their own design. They would fumble and fuck up every beat up to the very climax. He almost wants to spare them just to see what they\u2019d end up doing.<br><br>Almost.<br><br>Danny regards his watch. One minute more. He counts the seconds as they complain and spew hot air about the perfect design and how they alone could execute it. The boasting and bravado fades and is quickly replaced with rock-and-roll blasting on the Coliseum speakers.<br><br>With quick steps, Danny retreats behind a beeping arcade as the idiots spill out of the staff room and enter the laser tag arena for a quick fix of adrenaline. He quietly steps out of the shadows and counts ten paces to the staff room. He has exactly twenty-two minutes before their game ends.<br><br>He opens the door and enters the tiny room but unexpectedly gags when he\u2019s hit with the foul stench of stale beer, rancid coffee, and twisted cigarette butts in dirty ashtrays. He turns to his side slightly, and his eyes suddenly go wide beneath the mask.<br><br>What the fuck!<br><br>His heart thunders in his ears as he stares at a yellowing wall covered with caricatures of his favorite killers throughout history. His face tenses. He grinds his molars and tries to suppress the thing beneath the mask. He needs to take a moment, compose himself, and walk away.<br><br>Don\u2019t look at it. Just don\u2019t look at it\u2026<br><br>But he can\u2019t help himself. You don\u2019t laugh at legends\u2026<br><br>He reaches out and touches a caricature of the one they called The Miner. You don\u2019t laugh at legends\u2026 His mouth gapes open. His lips tremble. He hasn\u2019t felt like this in years.<br><br>You don\u2019t! Laugh! At legends!<br><br>He tries to turn away but his feet are blocks of cement. He feels prickles all over his body as blood courses violently through his veins and something contained begins to stir.<br><br>He closes his eyes and counts to ten. He hasn\u2019t improvised since his first design and that didn\u2019t go very well. He has to find his center.<br><br>Walk away.<br><br>Just walk away.<br><br>For the design.<br><br>He stares up at the wall of parody and takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes and counts down from ten. Then he opens his eyes to see all the warped and ridiculous faces laughing at him.<br><br>He wants to ignore them. He wants to walk away. He has to walk away. But something won\u2019t let him. And before he realizes what\u2019s happening the thing contained breaks free. He clenches his fist and smashes it against the wall.<br><br>Fuck the design!",

Activating the dry ice machine. Hunting the three stooges in slow motion through the cool, misty arena. And now he yanks the gleaming hunter knife out of a pulpy face rendered completely unrecognizable.<br><br>Shit. I must have stabbed him a hundred times in the head.<br><br>Danny narrows his gaze on the face but the strobe light plays tricks on him. Makes the face look like his past victims\u2014the faces changing with every blink of light.<br><br>He shakes his head and stares hard at the face. This is Tom. No. Can\u2019t be. Tom he stabbed in the legs. He\u2019s still alive, groveling about like a worm somewhere.<br><br>What about Pete? No. Can\u2019t be, Pete. He\u2019s pretty sure he decapitated Pete. It\u2019s not what he intended, but shit happens. He pushed the knife a little too hard. Cut a little too deep. A little too fiercely.<br><br>Well, if it isn\u2019t Pete. And it isn\u2019t Tom. It must be Bradley. Good\u2019ol Bradley. He\u2019s confronted with a sudden image of Bradley screaming as he silences him with a blade through the mouth. He nods and sighs. Yeah, it\u2019s Bradley. Definitely, Bradley.<br><br>He stares at the mangled face for a long moment. It\u2019s not as bad as he thought it would be. A little messy, but he can find a way to make this work.<br><br>The last time he improvised a design was with his dad. Bless his soul. He deserved a better design, a much better execution, but he hadn\u2019t realized how much he had bottled up inside. All those training drills and unrealistic expectations to bring back stories and medals pushed him over the edge.<br><br>It just came pouring out one night while camping in a way he hadn\u2019t expected. Happens all the time. Every day. To the best. He just didn\u2019t think it could happen to him. And here it is happening again.<br><br>The music stops for a moment to reveal someone sobbing and screaming for help.<br><br>Tom.<br><br>Danny marches through flashing light and dark, following a trail of warm blood through the maze. Soon the blood leads him to a young man dragging himself across the cement ground, desperately inching toward an exit door.<br><br>Danny approaches him menacingly. He kneels before him and stares at him. Despite the air-conditioning he feels sweat drip down his face and drip into the gathering pool of blood. And as he watches the sweat drip off his face, he realizes\u2014<br><br>He isn\u2019t wearing his mask. He touches his warm, bloody face and vaguely remembers removing the mask in the staff room after her ripped down every last caricature.<br><br>That\u2019s because The Ghost Face has nothing to do with this. This is something else. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s crediting The Ghost Face with these clumsy yet incredibly satisfying kills.<br><br>Tom looks up at Danny.<br><br>Danny wipes the sweat and blood off his face. They lock eyes.<br><br>Not so funny now, is it?<br><br>Danny places his knife in Tom\u2019s hand.<br><br>You know what a copycat is, don\u2019t you? Well, that\u2019s what you are. A failed copycat. A parody of a true killer.<br><br>Tom tries to attack Danny with the knife.<br><br>Easy there, Tom. You might hurt yourself\u2026<br><br>Tom\u2019s arm falls and splatters in blood, the knife dangling from the fingertips. He struggles to wrap his wet fingers around the hilt and attacks with the knife, hitting air over and over again.<br><br>Danny laughs. Politicians will use your story to campaign against beer, rock-and-roll and horror movies. That\u2019s the current angle I\u2019m considering. You like that angle, Tom?<br><br>Tom gasps and struggles to say something without success.<br><br>Danny inches closer. He lowers his voice to a cruel whisper and suggests a potential headline for his next article\u2014<br><br>Ghost Copycat. Tragedy hits Roseville Coliseum. Employee stabs two of his colleagues to death before suffering a lethal injury.<br><br>Danny considers, then offers an alternative version\u2014<br><br>Joke taken too far. Tragedy hits Roseville Coliseum. Three employees die in a prank gone horribly wrong after a night of drinking, rock-and-roll and horror movies.<br><br>Danny tilts his head slightly. He considers both versions of the story. The drinking, rock-and-roll and horror movies offer a comfortable scapegoat. It gives readers something to point to.<br><br>Something to blame.<br><br>A place to hide.<br><br>And he isn\u2019t sure he wants to give his readers a place to hide with this one. He leans closer to Tom. What do you think? Copycat or bad joke?<br><br>Tom murmurs something incoherent.<br><br>Danny smiles. Sorry, I didn\u2019t really get that. You\u2019re gonna have to speak up, buddy. Take a deep breath\u2026 enunciate. Come on\u2026 you\u2019re so full of fuckin' opinions\u2026 I\u2019m sure you have an opinion on how you\u2019d like to be remembered.<br><br>Tom writhes desperately and manages to issue one last, gasping scream before dying.<br><br>Danny sighs and closes his eyes against the blinking light. He still isn\u2019t sure which angle to take, and it doesn\u2019t really matter, anyway. Either version will do its job and scare the good citizens of Roseville into fastening the mask a little tighter before bed while they count their lucky stars and appreciate their ridiculously insane, suburban lives.",

She talks to herself under her breath.<br><br>Get a grip\u2026 get a grip\u2026<br><br>But she can\u2019t get a grip. Every breath, a struggle. Every movement, a jab in the gut. Her heart drums in her ears. Her brain perceives a threat, and her adrenal glands release a sudden surge of hormones. Adrenaline. Cortisol. The drum beats faster as terror paralyzes her. But this fear isn\u2019t physical. She isn\u2019t afraid of being burned alive or thrown off a cliff or dropped in a dark pit of writhing vipers.<br><br>What she dreads is standing on stage in front of strangers.<br><br>And telling them a story.<br><br>Ask people their greatest fear and the same one always sits at the top of the list. Public speaking. Why would that be? What makes embarrassment so much more terrifying than dismemberment?<br><br>Storytelling is as old as human history and Mikaela knows it\u2019s imbedded in her DNA. It\u2019s how she makes sense of the world. How she makes sense of herself. How she connects with others and communicates her truth. Finding that connection is Mikaela\u2019s addiction.<br><br>She could write her stories to be read or just let someone else tell them, but Mikaela knows she needs more. Much more. She needs the fear, the adrenaline, the fight-or-flight feeling. But most of all she needs that visceral connection with her audience. So they see what she sees. Believes what she believes.

Always the red ink. He had so many stupid rules. Don\u2019t repeat words. Don\u2019t split infinitives. Don\u2019t start sentences with conjunctions. Don\u2019t end sentences with a preposition.<br><br>Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t.

And she wanted her stories to be the opposite. The exact opposite\u2014friendly, inviting, honest.<br><br>Mikaela remembers arguing with Brandies often about his so-called rules and how some of the greatest stories ever told started almost every sentence with a conjunction. She even challenged Brandies to show her where his rules came from. And he had nothing to say. Nothing to show her. Nothing official, anyway. Just one literary cookbook contradicting the other.

She remembers him leaning over her desk. She remembers that smell. The smell of cheap aftershave fighting a losing battle with his B.O.

It\u2019s just who you are.<br><br>But even with all that negativity, she still managed to keep a tiny flame of inspiration alive. A sputtering flame nurtured by all the writers she'd loved. Mary Shelley. Edgar Allan Poe. Shirley Jackson. They didn\u2019t worry about following rules. They just created their characters. Told their stories. Built their worlds.",

Carl Jung believed that our subconscious connects to a collective unconscious that binds every human soul to primal symbols and ancient archetypes. That\u2019s why so many fears and phobias are universal. Why so many cultures have the same stories and mythologies.<br><br>Her muscles loosen under the hot spray and she remembers a writing circle where they talked about something called Dejavuism. The idea being that human brains could network with mirror beings on the same wavelength in other dimensions. One guy in the group thought that his inner voice was just another version of himself in a parallel dimension. Others in the circle laughed. She didn\u2019t. She even shared one of her stories based on a recurring nightmare.<br><br>The hot water loses its heat and Mikaela suddenly turns it off just as she\u2019s struck by an epiphany. What if she\u2019s dreaming real things in a sort of multiverse? What if this world made of nightmares is not a plane of existence separate from the daily reality we all experience? What if it\u2019s just one of many realities all existing at the same time.

Thrilled to experience another reality in the infinitude of the multiverse.<br><br>A dark castle courtyard. Skewered corpses surround a sobbing man. He\u2019s on his knees in the dirt as a black fog pulls back, revealing even more bloody corpses. He screams a name.<br><br>The screaming man doesn\u2019t wear medieval garb. He wears jeans. A black t-shirt. Running shoes. Mikaela sees others now. Some wear headphones and carry clipboards.<br><br>The stonework is actually painted wood. The ramparts are cardboard. The corpses are manikins decorated to look like the dead. She sees lights. A camera. A sobbing man who\u2019s facing his greatest fear: the loss of someone he deeply loves. Taken by the darkness. Taken by the fog\u2014<br><br>Always the fog.<br><br>Mikaela awakens with a start, but this time she isn\u2019t gripped by terror. She\u2019s seized by inspiration. She searches her drawer for a piece she started writing years ago. She finds the first draft and re-works it while the images are fresh in her mind. The story pours out of her like she\u2019s taking dictation. Like she\u2019s writing down something that already happened.<br><br>Because it did.<br><br>But when Mikaela reads the story aloud, it still sounds wordy. Prosaic. Clunky. There\u2019s no rhythm. No shape. No build. No vivid moments to perform. There\u2019s something wrong. Something blocking her. And she quickly understands what it is. She still unconsciously follows those rules\u2014<br><br>Those suffocating rules that were pounded endlessly into her head throughout her years at school. And now the story doesn\u2019t flow. Doesn\u2019t feel alive. Feels contrived. Heavy. Dead. And why? Because she still hesitates to break rules that were never rules in the first place.<br><br>Shit! What\u2019s going on with me? Why can\u2019t I do it?<br><br>Mikaela hurries into the living room and picks up a few of her favorite books. They all break the rules. All of them. Every writer she ever loved. Twain. Faulkner. Dickens. Poe. Brandies would have given them all F's in his class. And she can\u2019t even imagine what he would have done with quippy, young Shakespeare.<br><br>Shakespeare who was free from the shackles of the mind placed by processed teachers and assembly-line thinking. Shakespeare who was free to create his own rules and words without apology. Who wasn\u2019t worried about what some authority or critic had to say, and they had tons to say. And Mikaela knows his freedom was earned after a terrible bout with depression when his first play flopped and he refused to touch a quill for five years.<br><br>Five years!<br><br>It took him five years to mediate on storytelling to finally break free from the opinions of others.<br><br>But she doesn\u2019t have five years to meditate on storytelling even though she desperately wants\u2014<br><br>Shakespearean freedom!<br><br>How do I achieve that kind of freedom after all those years of trying to please others?<br><br>Shakespeare made his own words and rules and that\u2019s why he\u2019s immortal.<br><br>But I don\u2019t need to be immortal. I just need to tell a good story.<br><br>Mikaela clears her head of the swirling negativity and decides to tell the story she wants to tell. She\u2019ll need to reduce the story. Strip it to its core. Cut anything that slows it down. Change the passive to the active. Use words that paint perfect images in the imagination. And if she doesn\u2019t have the right word, she\u2019ll make one up. That\u2019s what she\u2019ll do. She\u2019ll make one up! But as the rebellious thought inspires her, it also scares her. Scares the hell out of her because she was taught to idolize final results instead of the struggle, the search, and the climatic fight every artist must go through to be free.<br><br>To be truly free.<br><br>The shackles are still there. She feels them dragging her down, but they\u2019re not as heavy as they used to be. And though she may not possess Shakespearean freedom yet\u2014<br><br>She can fake it.<br><br>For now.<br><br>And now, she rises to her feet and paces the living room as she recites the first draft of her story. She finds places for dramatic pauses. Places to add a gesture. Places to speed up. Places to shock the audience into gasping or screaming. She won\u2019t just play to them, she\u2019ll play with them. And she won\u2019t just tell the story, she\u2019ll live the story, so the audience lives it with her.",

I suppose the only thing I can do now is float with the tide and hope we find something here that brings us closer to the ones we\u2019ve lost. A few of us gathered around a small fire in the study and told stories about loved ones we\u2019ve all heard a hundred times but acted like it\u2019s the first time. I suppose that\u2019s because we know it helps to talk, laugh and remember the good times. Ahma told us about her little girl building motorcycle engines\u2014upgrading scooters and racing them in her small village. This version was a little more embellished than the last. No one can be that good on a scooter even if it had been modified or upgraded with plane parts. Nevertheless, they were amusing stories, and she told them well up until the moment she stopped abruptly, staring blankly at the fire, lost in a memory. No one said anything for a long while. I stared at the leaping flames and thought of the time you first learned to ride a bicycle. You were four years old and the first thing I taught you was how to fall. I told you to push yourself with your feet and fall safely to the left or right side. We practiced falling safely until the fear of falling was gone. Then I showed you how to pedal fast and use the speed to keep your balance. You succeeded on your first try because you were no longer scared of falling. You were so happy you jumped off your bike, hugged me and told me I was the best dad in the world. If I were to die today and live in that moment forever I would be a blessed man. I miss you with all my heart and hate what happened between us. I only hope for another chance to make things right.",

He wiped the cold sweat from his brow, opened the creaking door and entered the dark lobby. At once his heart sank as he stared upon a grim scene of death. Strewn across the floor were human corpses and the decaying remains of squid-like creatures, unlike anything he had ever seen before. He took a moment to compose himself. His bruised face, swollen feet and tattered clothes gave testament to the long and arduous journey through this dark dimension to find his adopted sister, Haley. Back home, he had connected with others who had lost loved ones in similar circumstances and together they had collected relics and artifacts with secret symbols that eventually helped them open a portal into this world made of nightmares. But no sooner had they entered the nightmare than they had been separated while being attacked by a shadow creature with an insatiable appetite for darkness.<br><br>Now Jaden was alone. Without the research\u2014or the \u2018codex\u2019 as some of them had grown accustomed to calling it\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure how he would escape when he found his sister. But he tried not to think about his predicament as he entered the lobby feeling like something or someone was watching him. Some distance away he had found the ruins of a tower with skeletons strewn across a mini-putt with an old French song playing on a scratchy gramophone. Now he was in an abandoned motel, reeking dead creatures around him. He didn\u2019t know what else to expect, but he was sure of one thing: more deadly creatures and mysterious ruins would be in the fog. Much more. Everything he had discovered about this world suggested it was a garden of infinite darkness beyond time and space.<br><br>Death\u2014he had read\u2014was not an escape.<br><br>Cautiously, Jaden walked down a deathly silent corridor with shaking hands toward a door. Above the door an exit sign blinked in and out of existence. The only sign of life was a rat the size of a dog chewing on the putrid flesh of one of the bloated squid creatures. As he passed a pile of bodies, he felt something behind him. He turned to see a sudden flash. An instant later he was staring down the edge of a gleaming katana. He gasped as he found himself staring at a woman in a red and black kimono. She reminded him of a protagonist in a story Haley had been collecting by an anonymous eighteenth century Japanese author.<br><br>\u201cSaku, wait!\u201d<br><br>Jaden\u2019s heart gave a great leap as he instantly recognized Surin\u2019s voice. He turned to see several other familiar faces amongst a small group of survivors. Beyond the faces he recognized\u2014Olivia, Sean and Elias\u2014he thought he saw Haley\u2019s estranged uncle, Mahan, in blood-stained fatigues, carrying a semi-automatic rifle.<br><br>Surin urgently turned to face a woman beside him. \u201cAriella,\u201d he said. \u201cTell Saku we know him. His name is Jaden. He came with us through the portal but we got separated. This place\u2026 it has his sister.\u201d<br><br>Ariella nodded, then gently placed her hand on Saku\u2019s wrist, translating Surin\u2019s words into Japanese. Within moments, Saku nodded her understanding and lowered her katana.<br><br>Jaden breathed again as Surin tossed him a rifle and a rusty machete, then introduced him to the new members of the group and told everyone to prepare for another assault from the fog. An instant later they dispersed to barricade and fortify the motel.",

One bearded prisoner sat up and stared at several names etched in a rock by the door. It read:<br><br>Amar Singh 1914<br><br>Adama Comba 1915<br><br>Omar Halimi 1916<br><br>Amrik 1917<br><br>Rup 1917<br><br>The prisoner had the sudden instinct to etch his own name lest he be forgotten. And so, he grabbed a small, sharp stone and just as he began to etch out his name, the thick wooden door slammed open and enemy soldiers shouted curses at the five prisoners in a language none of them understood while threatening them with gleaming bayonets.<br><br>The enemy soldiers gestured for them to stand, then ushered the five prisoners out of the darkness and into the golden light of dawn through a muddy, six-foot trench reeking of death.<br><br>As the prisoners hobbled toward a clearing, one soldier addressed them in broken English, telling them they had the honor of helping their captain and perhaps avoiding early morning target practice.<br><br>*<br><br>THE FIVE PRISONERS stood by the trench wall as an enemy soldier balanced tin cans over their heads. A translator approached them with the captain. The captain spoke, and the translator quickly interpreted, saying:<br><br>\u201cOne of you bastards will tell me about your secret mission. Speak up and I promise to send you to a proper camp where you will be fed and given immediate medical attention.\u201d<br><br>None of the five responded. The captain smirked, took twenty paces back, cocked his rifle, aimed and hit one soldier in the forehead, splitting his skull in two, sending a spray of blood across the other four.<br><br>The captain regarded them, hesitated, then cocked the rifle again. A sudden crack and another prisoner fell as the captain mockingly apologized for his terrible aim.<br><br>With a laugh, the captain aimed the rifle, squeezed the trigger, and hit the tin can. The can fell against the sandbags lining of the trench and clattered against debris. The captain prepared his rifle and shifted his aim to the next prisoner.<br><br>The prisoner stared at the rifle, closed his eyes, and repeated a phrase in an unknown language that resembled Latin. And just as the captain made to pull the trigger, a sudden piercing whistle suddenly caught everyone\u2019s attention. By the time the captain looked up, it was already too late, and he was reduced to fleshy fragments and bone shrapnel by an eighteen-pounder.<br><br>*<br><br>THE BEARDED PRISONER CRAWLED on the ground toward a trembling hand sticking out of a pile of debris. He frantically dug through the dirt and rubble as muffled screams and explosions filled his ears. Breathing hard, he managed to dig out one face and then another. Then he rose on shaking legs, grabbed one prisoner by the uniform and pulled him to his feet. Together they yanked the other prisoner from a mountain of rubble and took a moment to gather themselves. Limping and coughing, they grabbed rifles from the ground, rushed toward a ladder and climbed over the trench and into the barren wasteland.<br><br>Leaping over decomposing horses, bullets thumped in the mud all around the fleeing prisoners as they fell into a massive crater. As they desperately scrambled out, jumping over bodies and rats and pushing through clouds of flies, they suddenly and unexpectedly entered a maze of barbed wire attached to the scorched remains of trees. Pushing their way out of the maze, they once again entered a clearing and sprinted away without looking back until\u2014<br><br>They heard the rumble of an engine in the sky.<br><br>They turned to see the plane. One prisoner froze, grabbed his rifle and aimed as the plane approached them. Holding his breath, he pulled the trigger and large crows took flight from corpses as the bullet screamed through the air and\u2014<br><br>Missed.<br><br>He cocked the rifle again, calmed his nerves, and waiting for the right moment, squeezed the trigger. This time the bullet howled through the sky and hammered straight through the pilot\u2019s hardened face.<br><br>A moment later the plane rose, then span wildly out of control.<br><br>The prisoners watched in disbelief as the plane crashed into their pursuers, crushing and cutting and burning them up in a swirling ball of fire.<br><br>As they took in the grisly scene, the world seemed to tremble violently and the ground beneath their feet instantly disappeared. The three prisoners fell, arms flailing, into a massive sink hole as dust, soot and barbed wire covered them.<br><br>*<br><br>WHEN THE DUST settled, the three prisoners surveyed their surroundings to discover they were in an ancient temple immersed in a strange black fog and arcane symbols etched in the surrounding walls. They had inadvertently discovered the lost temple they had been sent out to find before the secret enemy units that had been created to secure hidden occult knowledge all over the world. Now all they had to do was report their discovery to the newly formed Intelligence Division.<br><br>And so the prisoners desperately climbed out of the temple and found themselves in familiar yet unfamiliar territory. The bleak, body-ridden landscape seemed like No Man\u2019s Land, but there was something strange about the scene. All around were mazelike walls of barbed wire and scorched trees where bodies dangled from hooks that glistened red under a hunter\u2019s moon. Each prisoner stared at the bodies and the hooks confused, each wondering if they had been there before.<br><br>The sudden high-pitch buzz of a chainsaw startled the prisoners, and they instinctively took cover beside a burning tank. As a cloud of heaving black fog approached them, they knew something was different with the hell they had grown accustomed to for the last three years.<br><br>They sensed that they had somehow discovered something lost and forgotten to time in the hidden temple, or that this lost and forgotten thing had somehow discovered them and that this thing, this ancient thing\u2014whatever it was\u2014had pushed them out of the frying pan and into the cosmic fire.",

She had been traveling through the Many-Realms, searching for her enemies for what felt like thousands of centuries, and yet she didn\u2019t feel a day older. There was so much she still didn\u2019t understand. She had learned about other worlds and people and their unique cultures and languages, and though she knew a lot about these different worlds, she knew very little about the Many-Realms. This dark and mysterious place made of nightmares that she had unwittingly entered long ago while chasing down Black Serpent disciples through a veil of fog. Saku had tracked down and killed twelve of the twenty-one disciples. Nine remained. But Saku wasn\u2019t worried. She would get them sooner or later. Time was somehow on her side.<br><br>Now Saku followed bars of blue-tinged light along a track through dark tunnels of concrete covered in graffiti. She halted as she saw a bright light approach her. Quickly, she sprang to the side and vaulted up on a ledge just as a train filled with bodies came charging past her with a rush of air and the stench of rotting flesh.<br><br>When the train passed, Saku jumped back down on the tracks and continued through the darkness, following the glowing blue bars as the fog began to thicken and she heard crows cawing somewhere in the distance. She instinctively grabbed the hilt of her katana as dozens of cannibals with gleaming red eyes and rotten teeth suddenly surrounded her.<br><br>The cannibals closed in on her slowly. Then, with a terrible shriek, they attacked. She evaded several blows with crude weapons and backed away. When they rushed her again, she unsheathed her katana and turned into a tempest of blood.<br><br>With incredible speed, Saku cut through the horde like weeds. She fought twenty rounds before it was all over. Then she wiped her katana and walked away without looking back as the sounds of crows feasting on freshly cut flesh echoed through the tunnel.<br><br>Carefully, Saku followed the tracks and stopped only when she heard a voice calling out for help. It wasn\u2019t a voice she recognized, but it was somehow coming from all directions as if it were in her head.<br><br>Saku turned round and round but didn\u2019t see anyone. She heaved a deep breath and figured the world was once again playing tricks on her as it often did. Ignoring the voice, she continued her journey through the subway, and emerging out of the tunnel, she found herself submerged in an ocean of fog as she pushed her way into another realm.",

Cautiously, she followed the voice, wondering if the world was helping her on her journey to destroy the Black Serpent Society or toying with her. As though the growing fog could read her thoughts, she suddenly saw a serpent head in the distance. Slowly, she approached the towering structure and halted when she realized what it was.<br><br>An offering to the Black Serpent.<br><br>Bodies stacked upon bodies, all twisted and warped to resemble a serpent\u2019s head. Dripping vines as thick as a leg held the bodies together. A dozen symbols carved into the flesh writhed and crawled with worms and insects. Beneath the offering was a sign inscribed with crimson letters written in a language she didn\u2019t understand. She had seen several of these offerings back home and she knew the creator was not far from the creation; or, perhaps, was still embedded in the structure.<br><br>With great care, Saku inspected every inch of the offering. None of the faces seemed to be alive. No nostrils flared. No eyes blinked. No fingers twitched. Then as she turned away from the offering, she heard a laugh. A deep sonorous laugh. Instantly, she peered in the darkness and saw a man in a dark robe beckoning her.<br><br>Fixing her gaze on the Black Serpent disciple, she determined to end his days as a corruptor and slice him into ribbons. The blood in her veins warmed as she closed her eyes and slowed her breathing, preparing to attack.<br><br>In her mind\u2019s eye, Saku saw herself rushing through the trees, leaping, and slicing right through his neck. Then her eyes snapped open and she began a slow gait toward her enemy. Her pace quickened to a deadly sprint. Within moments she lunged into the air with her gleaming katana. A second later she landed, staring at the disciple as the head fell with a heavy thud and rolled to a stop by a pile of thick leaves. A geyser of arterial blood sprayed the ancient trees. But\u2014<br><br>The torso didn\u2019t stagger.<br><br>Didn\u2019t convulse.<br><br>Didn\u2019t collapse.<br><br>Instead, it squatted and searched the ground for its missing head. Realizing this was all a trick being played on her by a cruel world, she cursed her frustration as the severed head began to laugh at her.<br><br>The apparition stood, holding the laughing head, every cackle adding to her humiliation. With a terrible cry, Saku sliced the false serpent into a thousand pieces, each piece burning like a bright orange ember as it fell and disintegrated into the stewing fog from which it had been born.<br><br>After a long silence, Saku continued through the forest toward another realm as massive branches suddenly crashed down all around her, trying to crush her like a bug. Slicing through falling branches, she rushed through the onslaught\u2014leaping, dodging, somersaulting\u2014and she didn\u2019t stop until she was out of the woods.",

Ahead she saw a tower standing atop a column of rock that rose from the darkness below. Just above the tower there hovered a strange airship covered in purple gore and dead creatures with squid-like heads and tentacles dangling from the sides. A wooden ladder connected to the cockpit was lowered to the tower`s roof. Someone was searching for something inside the tower.<br><br>Cautiously, Saku inched along the rocky crest and noticed a wooden bridge extending from the cliff to the tower`s entrance. Wanting to inspect the abandoned structure, she carefully inched across the creaking bridge and nearly fell three times. But each time she managed to regain her footing until finally she was at the base of the tower.<br><br>Entering the tower, Saku soon discovered it was full of journals written in Korean and filled with illustrations of strange insects and creatures observed in the realm. She moved from room to room as she ascended the spiral wooden stairs to the roof. In each room, she found stacks of endless journals of a despairing mind. A mind not unlike her own. A mind that longed for companionship and laughter and talks under moonlit skies.<br><br>Saku had been alone for what seemed like an eternity and more than anything she missed talking and laughing with friends and family. Her journey had taken its toll on her, and for a second, just a second, she contemplated making this tower her final resting place. But as despair began to overwhelm her senses, she heard a voice calling out to her for help. A voice that seemed to be coming from the roof.<br><br>With a start, Saku dashed up the stairs, unexpectedly scaring a young man who froze wide-eyed for a moment as though he recognized her. Then the young man grabbed a collection of scrolls and bolted up the stairs screaming for someone named Haley.<br><br>Saku cried for him to stop and chased him up to the roof. Not to hurt him but to know more about who he was, where he came from, and how he ended up traveling on an airship in this endless nightmare. But it was too late. By the time she rushed through the doorway, the airship ladder had been pulled up into the cockpit, and the heavy motor was moaning a lonesome note into the endless abyss.<br><br>Slowly but surely, the airship pushed through the billowing fog, sounding a deep fog horn now and then so as to ward off creatures of the abyss.<br><br>Saku stared after the airship for a long time after it disappeared. Then she staggered back and collapsed beside a human skeleton secured in a bolted chair with a fishing rod in his hands. Countless bones of strange creatures he had pulled out of the abyss lay around him.<br><br>Saku laughed out loud for a moment, then she went silent, and tears began down her cheek. She shuffled back, grabbed the bottle in his boney hands and soon downed the liquid fire. Then she grabbed the rod and cast a line out into the swirling fog below.<br><br>There Saku spent hours catching nothing and talking about everything to absolutely no one. Then she climbed over the edge of the outer wall and for a moment she wanted let go of everything and let herself fall when suddenly\u2014<br><br>She heard the voice.<br><br>She fell back into a pile of bones with a terrible clatter and laughed and cursed at herself for letting the nightmare get to her. Clambering to her feet, she staggered down the stairs, and continued her journey through the Many-Realms.",

As she moved through the massive, overgrown, crumbling arms and legs and heads on the ground, she couldn\u2019t help but notice the faces of the statues were blank. There were no features. No eyes. No cheeks. No lips. Nothing. Just a blank slate. And as she passed the fallen statues, she heard a slight crumble and crackle of stone. Turning, she spotted the Black Serpent disciple in a thick black kimono meditating in the middle of the open palm of a severed, stone hand.<br><br>Narrowing her gaze, Saku stared at the disciple for a long while, trying to decipher if he was real or just another attempt for this dark world to humiliate her. An instinct told her he was one of the twenty-one she had followed into the Many-Realms.<br><br>Stealthily, she approached him like a panther on the hunt. She climbed the crumbling wrist and squeezed her way through two plump fingers. And just as she withdrew her katana with a ring and leaped to end his days as a servant of darkness, a massive hand caught her mid-air and lifted her to face its empty face. Then the empty face seemed to morph in and out of a thousand different faces as though she were staring at the very mask of eternity.<br><br>Saku shuddered at the sight and quickly turned to the open palm on the ground. The disciple was already gone. She cursed something terrible. Her face hardened, and she twisted and thrust out of the giant statue\u2019s grip, falling on the ground like a nimble cat.<br><br>A second later a fist came crashing down, sending a rain of dirt and debris high in the air. With great speed, Saku evaded blow after blow as the giant statue devastated the graveyard, searching for her.<br><br>The giant statue lifted limbs and thrust them against the ground. But Saku leaped from hiding place to hiding place as she waited for her chance to escape. And through this graveyard of fallen idols, she played cat and mouse for twenty or so rounds before the giant finally gave Saku the opportunity she needed to escape through a column of swirling fog.",

Saku bounded up the hill, past dead creatures and impaled bodies and entered the arched doorway of an overgrown coliseum. She rushed up crumbling steps into the stands and moved slowly toward the ancient arena. She froze suddenly at the sight of the Black Serpent disciple she had been tracking for the last few days or weeks\u2014she couldn\u2019t quite remember. He was lying on his stomach, eating dirt, groaning and agonizing with four bleeding stumps where arms and legs used to be. A pool of sticky, crimson blood grew around him.<br><br>Slowly, Saku approached the dying man, waiting for him to disappear into the fog like all the other cruel apparitions the world had created for its amusement. But when he didn\u2019t disappear, or laugh at her, she realized he was real and not a fabrication of the nightmare.<br><br>Saku moved closer and prodded and pushed the torso with her foot until he was lying on his back, staring up at her with bloodshot eyes and trembling lips. Frothy saliva and blood made bubbles as he desperately begged for a quick end.<br><br>Instead, Saku stepped back, sat crossed-legged in the dirt and watched him die the slow and miserable death he deserved. As he begged for the swiftness of her sword, crows appeared from the darkness and surrounded the squirming worm of a man. Then they picked and pecked at the human worm until there was nothing left but bones.<br><br>When the crows disappeared into the darkness, Saku rose and dusted the dirt off her kimono. Taking a deep, calming breath, she withdrew her katana and decapitated the head. She watched the head roll away as the sky darkened and it began to rain bone and gore.<br><br>Saku looked up at the sky, confused, but not surprised. She had never experienced anything like it, and sensing danger, she rushed into a nearby tunnel, wiping off chunks of flesh and pulling out a piece of sharp bone that had pierced her shoulder.<br><br>Patiently, Saku waited at the edge of the tunnel as the arena thrashed with flesh and filled with blood. Over the thumping organs and entrails, she heard a clang behind her. Slowly, she turned around to face\u2014<br><br>Dozens upon dozens of undead gladiators.<br><br>With a deep sigh, she held her katana at the ready as she slowly backed into the gore-covered arena. The gladiators approached her slowly then, all at once, rushed her with axes, spears, and heavy swords.<br><br>Saku battled the gladiators until the last head rolled and the hellish shrieks and cries ceased. Exhausted, she staggered back and collapsed into a crimson stew of death. There she stared up at the night sky, hoping against hope to wake up from the nightmare that had become her life.",

Several times she got stuck, then found the strength to pull herself free and continue despite the barrage of dark and despairing thoughts that continued to assail her with every step.<br><br>At last, she traversed the marsh but collapsed right at the edge. With trembling arms and legs, she clambered to her feet and froze, staring at jagged mountains in the distance.<br><br>Paralyzed by despair, she realized she didn\u2019t know what she would do once she fulfilled her promise and killed the last disciple. Nothing she did would ever bring her clan back, and for a moment, she wanted to fall back and let herself sink into oblivion.<br><br>There would be nothing after. No anger. No hate. No revenge. Just loneliness and all the memories of what had been lost. Slowly, Saku extended her bloody hands in front of her face and stared at them for a long moment. Then she lowered her hands and winced in pain. A slow trickle of puss dripped down the length of her arm from a deep wound.<br><br>Saku had to take care of the injury before it festered.<br><br>Or, she didn\u2019t.<br><br>She wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted anymore.<br><br>The despair was stronger than it had ever been. It clouded her judgment\u2014blurred meaning and memory so that she couldn\u2019t fully remember her reasons, her purpose, her past. And now the only thing she felt was\u2014<br><br>Abandoned.<br><br>By everyone she ever knew and loved.<br><br>And she knew this was an absurd thought but couldn\u2019t help thinking it.<br><br>Saku stood there for what felt like an eternity, just staring at the mountain before her. Feeling alone, she closed her eyes and tried to remember bits and pieces of her life. With difficulty, she remembered faces, voices, and laughter. And she remembered\u2014<br><br>Her promise.<br><br>Her promise to bring her clan honor by finishing what they had started.<br><br>By eliminating the Black Serpent Society once and for all.<br><br>But first Saku needed to eliminate her doubt and despair, crippling thoughts and feelings amplified by the living nightmare. Opening her eyes, she crushed each dark thought like a psychic bug. Then, from a small pouch, she pulled out a piece of cloth and proceeded to dress her wound.<br><br>And as she did, a strained voice called out for help. At first faintly, and then louder and louder. She didn\u2019t try to understand any of it. And though she knew the nightmare could be setting her up for a trap, she followed the voice toward the mountains.",

She clambered over piles of armored soldiers from all time periods who had fought a hopeless battle against an enormous creature with dozens of tentacles the size of buildings. The lifeless tentacles still held mangled soldiers and civilians in its death-grip, mouths wide open, frozen in terror. It seemed like the creature had attacked hundreds of survivors from other worlds who had perhaps come together to make some kind of a home in the nightmare. But it didn\u2019t matter what anyone did to feel normal again, somehow the horror always found a way.<br><br>Saku had seen it countless times during her travels throughout the Many-Realms. The fragments of communities that had somehow risen from the ashes of destroyed and forgotten worlds only to be destroyed by some incomprehensible creature from the abyss. It was futile.<br><br>Taking in the aftermath of the battle, Saku sighed at the carnage all around her. It had taken hundreds of soldiers to kill the creature and yet she wasn\u2019t sure if it was dead. As she scanned the bodies, she noticed the tentacles twitching now and then. But she ignored the erratic movements as involuntary death-spasms as she followed a decomposing tentacle through a wall of fog toward a faint neighing sound.<br><br>As she followed the tentacle, the neighing grew louder and somehow made words in her head. She kicked over and pushed aside bodies searching for the source of the pleas until at last she found a struggling horse in a thick stew of gore trapped underneath a massive tentacle.<br><br>Cautiously, she squatted beside the struggling horse and watched it for a long moment as its desperate calls formed words in her mind. She didn\u2019t try to understand any of it. And she didn\u2019t think it could be understood. This world had shown her that everything she thought impossible was possible and that anything that could be imagined could somehow exist somewhere in the nightmare.<br><br>Now Saku told the horse everything was going to be okay and that she would get him out of his predicament as she struggled to lift the tentacle. Her words seemed to reassure him. But just as he neighed to thank her, the massive eye of the creature blinked open.<br><br>The eye blazed like no eye should ever blaze.<br><br>And without hesitation Saku whirled and plunged her katana into its pupil. Blood splattered and instantly filled the white of the eye, and the creature shrieked terribly as it issued its last breath. Withdrawing her katana, Saku returned to the horse, sliced the massive tentacle, and freed him. Then she mounted the grateful horse and rode off into the abyss.",

It was as if the symbols were alive. But Saku knew this to be impossible and was sure her mind was playing tricks on her.<br><br>With a start, she tossed the scroll in the growing fire. Then she rose and stood amongst the hacked corpses of her enemy, adding logs of bone and flesh to the hungry, upleaping flames.

They listen to her thoughts and laugh at her jokes and talk to her and invite her to things. Grown-ups, kids, everybody. Renato tried one of her jokes himself. No one laughed.<br><br>He stops studying the other kids and watches his sister. She is special, even among the kids their age. He makes eye contact with her and she smiles. He smiles back, but it\u2019s a sad smile. He knows, no matter how hard he tries, no one will ever look at him the way they look at her.<br><br>Finally, Thalita ends her talk and it\u2019s time to throw their kites into the air. It\u2019s a beautiful, sunny day, bright even through his sunglasses. He hears some of the kids comment that it\u2019s too bright to see their kites so high above the beach, but he doesn\u2019t let them distract him. He can see his kite just fine. And he can see his opponents\u2019 kites, too.<br><br>Thalita says it\u2019s unsportsmanlike to knock out other kites so quickly. Renato never understood this. It\u2019s literally the game. His smile grows as each opponent falls. A true, joyous smile.<br><br>Hold on. Why has my string gone slack? Renato looks up and sees his kite floating downward.<br><br>Thalita\u2019s cheering next to him, grabbing his shoulders and whooping.<br><br>No. This cannot happen. If I can\u2019t be popular and I can\u2019t be a winner, then what can I be?\"",

He stood frozen, unable to think or move as the rest of the rag-tag squad pushed through the fog. Dwayne released a startled gasp as he came up beside Derek and Mel, and he pointed, mouth agape, toward a rolling desert of putrefied bodies soaking in an endless stew of scintillating, blue energy. Forgotten memories dragged up from the blue sea like feverish ghosts and ghouls and then disappeared in a swirl of fog. Screams, shrieks, sobs, and maniacal laughter overwhelmed them. Heads, limbs and bodies fell from the dark sky, crashing over piles of bones and rubble, shaking the world as though The Horror itself took everything dark and vile in existence and shook it in a mixing-bag.<br><br>Jaden steadied himself for a moment, then stepped up to Mahan. \u201cYou think it\u2019s here?\u201d<br><br>Mahan scanned the endless ruins. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered flatly. The rank odor of rotting bodies and mold invaded his nostrils. \u201cWhat I do know is we can\u2019t stand in one place for too long or\u2014\u201d<br><br>\u201cDark memories will drag us down in a pit of madness,\u201d Haley interrupted. \u201cMemories so vivid you\u2019d think they were your own.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMemories of horrors past!\u201d Mahan confirmed, staring at the residual memory of an executioner raising his ax over his head and suddenly lobbing off the head of a panicking prisoner. The head rolled over a ground strewn with bodies in various forms of dismemberment, and then the entire memory\u2014the executioner and the dead prisoner\u2014dissipated into the swelling blue like a midnight sea. This was The Void, and it was far worse than anything Mahan had read about in the scroll he had scavenged off the dead samurai. \u201cIf the memories don\u2019t get you\u2026 the creatures will.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat creatures?\u201d Max asked, shoving his way past Sam and Eric who stared in shock at the countless memories materializing and dematerializing before them. \u201cWhat are we talking about here?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhatever horror you can imagine,\u201d Haley answered. \u201cThis place\u2026 it\u2019s a cosmic dump of all things horrific and terrible\u2026 and\u2026 from what we\u2019ve been able to gather\u2026 our only hope.\u201d<br><br>Surin approached Mahan, crunching brittle bones with every step. He stopped at the top of a small mound of rubble and looked back at Haley. \u201cCan you do your thing here?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d want to,\u201d Grace said in a low, breathy voice, pushing out of the rupture through a curtain of fog.<br><br>Haley nodded. \u201cMrs. Sherwood\u2019s right. I could lose myself in these\u2014these endless memories.\u201d<br><br>A bone suddenly crunched behind her.<br><br>Haley turned to watch Claudine kneel by a cluster of glowing purple and pink flowers pushing out of a mound of death and decay. Taking caution, Claudine pulled out her scissors and quickly clipped a sample, adding the strange flowers to her backpack where she kept a collection of flora samples plucked from various realms in The Horror.<br><br>The squad stood in silence for a long while as they absorbed this new part of The Horror.<br><br>\u201cWe should move,\u201d Mahan said at last, and he took a small, cautious step forward as he watched the residual memory of a soldier form and rush toward a strange object.<br><br>Mahan narrowed his gaze. It took him a moment to work out what he was seeing as the soldier stepped on a mine and exploded into a shower of gore and blood. There in the distance he thought he saw an old World War One fortress tank. One of the many ridiculous tanks he had seen in a history book. He remembered reading about the Fortress Tank and laughing at the absurdity of it. He remembered reading that the tank had been designed but never actually built.<br><br>Not in his world, anyway.<br><br>What Mahan knew and what he had learned in his world didn\u2019t really matter much\u2026 not anymore.<br><br>The tank could provide shelter and protection if its huge caterpillar tracks somehow\u2014by some cosmic miracle\u2014worked. Maybe the tank could provide refuge just like the ruined tower had long ago. Maybe, like the tower, he would find other survivors there eking out some kind of existence.<br><br>In the end, Mahan didn\u2019t know what he would find. All he knew is he needed to get his squad out of this sea of dark memories and into that fortress. And so, Mahan signaled for attention with his rifle, said a few encouraging words, and led the squad toward the most absurd tank he had ever seen in his life.",

Dark clouds hung on the horizon the entire day, refusing to approach, waiting for some resolution.<br><br>Nearly a dozen men, dressed in broken and incomplete sets of armor, some armed with swords, others with plows and hoes, stand in a crooked line in front of him.

And waits. Stares through his mask at the men. Waits.<br><br>They rush him, disorganized, terrified. He fells them, one by one. No wasted movement. Their attacks do not touch him. One after another, they run up against his weapon and crumple, bleeding, in the water.<br><br>He stands there long after they have all fallen, feet still planted. Around his ankles the river begins to flow. Eleven tendrils of crimson stretch down the river. The clouds finally crack open as cold, heavy rain sets in.

No stolen armor, no stolen weapon. Tears dot his cheeks, obscured by rain, but he shows no fear. The boy pulls the rake from Kazan\u2019s leg and raises it, mimicking the stance of a true samurai.

They carved the symbols into a strange growth so that it exploded and destabilized the realms, creating a small rupture into The Void.

Not because I\u2019m special or spectacular or anything like that but because he thought I was weak and scrawny and good for nothing like a cart without wheels. For some reason he swore to his wife that I was cursed and that bad things had been happening to him and his farm ever since I arrived. He figured if he called me \u2018Magnificent\u2019 he\u2019d trick some bucket-head into buying me at the country fair. I remember figuring I was different than the other colts not because I made bad things happen but because I could make things happen, and I could make things happen just by thinking about them. I didn\u2019t realize it at first. But anyone who showed interest in buying me and taking me from my home changed their mind because I told them to do so with my thoughts and with my thoughts alone. I even used my thoughts to convince someone to tell Farmer Shelby what a fine horse I was and that he should keep me with my family. But that little trick didn\u2019t work. Farmer Shelby saw right through the ruse. He somehow suspected I was behind his bad luck in selling me, and he gave me such a lashing every night, yelling at me and calling me a dumb, ill-bred, good-for-nothing animal. Eventually, I didn\u2019t have the strength to think anymore. He beat it all out of me. I was in so much pain I could barely stand and all I could think about was not getting lashed, again. But that was okay because I was so bruised and broken up that no one believed I was magnificent despite the big, red sign above my head. I guess it kind of worked out in that way. At least for a little while. But let\u2019s move on from that cloudy moment in my life and come back to it a little later.<br><br>What I want to say is I\u2019m old now, and I\u2019m stuck in a faraway world that feels like every scary place I\u2019ve ever heard about all rolled into one. I have definitely lived and seen and experienced things no horse has ever seen. And, I\u2019ll tell ya, despite all the manure shoveled my way throughout my days, I\u2019ve only made one or two friends that have made the suffering bearable. And to be sure, it is one such friend who wants to write the story of my life. She believes that what I have been through and what she has been through could someday help someone going through a similar situation. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if all this will be helpful. What I do know is I hadn\u2019t talked for like an eternity before I met her and once we started talking, I just couldn\u2019t shut my trap. Kind of like an endless geyser. I guess I didn\u2019t realize how much I had to say, or how much I had kept bottled inside, or how much I needed to talk and that talking alone had lifted such a heaviness from my heart that I felt like I could fly. It\u2019s great to have a friend, especially one who doesn\u2019t judge or interrupt and who listens with the heart and not the head. A friend who understands you, believes in you, and who calls you magnificent and means it. Truly means it. I may not know much but I know this\u2014<br><br>One good friend makes all the difference.",

                        "text": "The Fortress Tank was littered with burnt cadavers. Twisted limbs reached out like black gnarled trees against the blue light seeping through a hole in the metal ceiling. Scorch marks scarred the floor and on the wall, Haley read, \u2018No Exit\u2019 written in blood. She stared at the words for a long, pensive moment. Then the squad assembled around her, asking if she could pick up anything with her abilities. She shrugged and inched closer to the bodies, feeling a strange heaviness in the air. She could sense there was something unnatural and unknown still lingering about the corridor.<br><br>Cautiously, Haley inched toward a crushed head on the metal grate and froze mid-step when she felt her arms prickle. She let her foot fall slowly and fixed her gaze on the charred eye sockets, searching for something, anything\u2014anything that could help understand what had happened to the previous crew.<br><br>When nothing appeared, she raised her gaze and started when a ghostly soldier suddenly flashed before her eyes. Composing herself, she watched the soldier scramble down the dark corridor with entrails wiggling out of his lacerated stomach like giant worms.<br><br>Sam sensed Haley was distraught and asked her what she was seeing. She turned to face him but tumbled backward and gasped at the sudden vision of gas-soaked soldiers going up in flames. The flames erupted and melted fat and flesh like butter until everything dissipated into plumes of swirling, blue smoke.<br><br>Clambering to her feet and steadying herself, Haley breathed deeply and turned to the squad with a bleak expression. She said nothing for a long moment. She debated whether she should share her visions with the rest of the squad. But she wasn\u2019t sure if what she had seen could be trusted. It could have been a memory, or it could have been a hallucination triggered by The Void.<br><br>Finally, she admitted she wasn\u2019t sure about what she had seen and told the squad she needed more time to investigate. So saying, she made her way to a pile of mangled bodies, grabbed a charred hand and closed her eyes. Silencing her mind, she focused all her senses on the moment, but nothing came to her.<br><br>\u201cThe whispers,\u201d Jaden said, approaching his stepsister. \u201cThey\u2019ve stopped\u2026 it\u2019s like the tank is somehow shielding us from the outside.\u201d<br><br>Haley opened her eyes and regarded him. Then she released the lifeless hand. \u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d She gestured toward the scattered bodies with an uneasy sigh.<br><br>\u201cGood question,\u201d Natasha commented as she scanned the massive tank for signs of life. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be staying here for a bit. Doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ve been in worse places back home.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSpeak for yourself, Nat,\u201d Jen shook her head. \u201cThis is a death trap. We should look for another place.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat other place?\u201d Derek asked. \u201cThere is no other place. Let\u2019s clear the rooms and make this can-of-hell pleasant.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPleasant?\u201d Mel questioned. \u201cAm I the only one smelling that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cSmelling what?\u201d Dwayne smirked.<br><br>Mel turned to Dwayne. She wanted to smack the glasses off his face for downplaying the stench. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018smelling what?\u2019 Barbequed humanity. That\u2019s what.\u201d<br><br>Dwayne shrugged. \u201cJust breathe through your mouth.\u201d<br><br>Mel shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to breathe through my mouth!\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m sure Claudine will think of something with her flowers.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery funny, Ash!\u201d Claudine\u2019s face hardened. \u201cI\u2019m not collecting air fresheners here, or are you that clueless?\u201d And she shoved Ash, who was laughing, into the hard, metal wall with a resonating clang.<br><br>\u201cKnock it off!\u201d Mahan snapped. \u201cLet\u2019s split up\u2026 Check the rooms for survivors. See if we can find something useful like medical supplies.\u201d<br><br>The squad agreed with nods and whispers and soon dispersed throughout the tank.<br><br>At this point Mahan motioned for Haley and Jaden to follow him as he picked his way through the dark corridor with his flashlight. After what seemed like a lifetime, they found a control room lined with generators that had somehow been grafted to the wall. Nearby there was a container filled with a strange, bubbling, black substance. From the container a thick red hose extended to the generators.<br><br>Mahan scrutinized the container, the generators, and the dashboard. It seemed like the black fluid somehow fueled the generators, and the generators somehow powered the fortress. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure how this makeshift energy system worked, but he had seen the technology before in other realms. For a moment, he had the faint hope that the generators and the tank had been designed to help them survive The Void.<br><br>\u201cThey\u2019re similar to the other generators.\u201d Jaden observed as he passed his finger along the controls until he found a small window covered in grime and other substances he didn\u2019t want to think about.<br><br>Mahan approached a generator and tried to activate it, but nothing happened. He removed a panel and tinkered with wires like he had done countless times before. Within moments, the generator sparked, belched, and grumbled to life as a light bulb flickered on and off casting a soft orange glow in the room.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a power!\u201d Haley smiled.<br><br>\u201cThanks to\u2026\u201d<br><br>Jaden\u2019s words trailed away as the ground shook beneath his feet and a deep sonorous roar came from outside. With a great sense of urgency, he used his sleeve to clear the grime from the window. As he stared out into The Void a shudder ran through him and the blood drained from his face.<br><br>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Haley asked.<br><br>When Jaden didn\u2019t answer, Mahan turned toward Haley, then Jaden and asked, \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s out there?\u201d<br><br>Still, he didn\u2019t answer.<br><br>Haley and Mahan exchanged a worried look as the world shook, again.<br><br>\u201cCome see this\u2026\u201d Jaden finally stammered. His voice came out in a thin croak, and he felt his nerves growing taut as he fought down a surge of panic. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. It was unlike anything he had ever seen in the other realms.<br><br>Staggering and helping one another, Haley and Mahan stepped behind Jaden.<br><br>All three looked through the small window in openmouthed disbelief.",

They find an appropriate place: quiet, nice view, small cactus growing nearby. Caleb hands Rory a shovel and the two start digging at the hard, dry earth.<br><br>The sun pokes over the horizon as they finish digging. Caleb places Declan\u2019s shattered, perforated body in the grave. They cover him and place a small marker on top, a pile of sturdy rocks. Rory coughs, perhaps from all the gunpowder, perhaps choking back tears. His voice comes out even smaller than normal.<br><br>Should we say something?<br><br>Caleb looks down at the fresh grave.<br><br>Never was good with words. That was Declan\u2019s thing.<br><br>The two stand in silence for a moment. Caleb counts in his head how many men they\u2019ve lost. Seven\u2026 no, eight. Since the Hellshire Gang had grown it was hard to keep track. Not anymore, though. Declan\u2019s body was the only one he could even find enough of to bury.<br><br>A cool gust of wind passes over the site, pushing the last of the night\u2019s chill, making room for the sun to bake the earth again. A paper blows in, catches on Rory\u2019s leg. He grabs it, picks it up, tries his best to read it.<br><br>Hey chief. This say what I think it says?<br><br>Caleb reaches for the paper and reads the headline out loud.<br><br>Henry Bayshore Purchases Hellshire Penitentiary.<br><br>Every muscle in his head starts to clench and burn. His hand trembles as he grips the paper, punching his thumb through the picture of Bayshore.<br><br>Saddle up. We\u2019re riding out.",

He shuddered when one of the tentacles grabbed a carcass of some nameless creature and held it in front of the dark retina. The eyeball seemed to be inspecting the carcass when suddenly the retina opened to reveal curved and crooked teeth like twisted swords. \u201cOh shit,\u201d he mumbled in disbelief and staggered backward. He quickly regained his balance, turned to Haley, and asked, \u201cWhat do we do? Did you see that thing? It\u2019s coming right for us.\u201d<br><br>Haley observed the surreal giant eyeball through the small window and released a slow measured breath. \u201cI think I remember reading about it\u2026\u201d She stared at the creature for a long moment as if she were trying to unravel some long-forgotten mystery. \u201cI read about it in one of the tomes we found. It\u2019s a creature of the abyss, one of the great Giants. This one\u2026 this one was called\u2026 Iggothuul\u2026 and it\u2019s attracted to light\u2026 or fear\u2026or was it light and fear\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhich one?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d she said, staring at the grotesque creature slowly approaching them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure which version of the story was right.\u201d<br><br>\u201cLet\u2019s imagine they all were!\u201d Mahan turned to the panel and yanked several levers to shut down the lights.<br><br>But nothing happened.<br><br>The generators didn\u2019t power down. The lights seemed to flicker and shine brighter just to spite him. And Iggothuul did not pause or hesitate in its steady advancement toward them.<br><br>Thinking fast, Mahan turned and kicked the generators with all his strength. But again, the lights only surged and grew brighter as though to continue to mock him. Then, realizing he was kicking the wrong mechanism, Mahan lunged forward and smashed the containers holding the strange, organic petrol connected to the generators. The glass shattered and the reeking black fluid drained to the floor with tiny fish-like things flopping over the ground. A moment later the generators stopped jerking and chugging and belching. The lights flickered on and off, and slowly dimmed to complete darkness.<br><br>Suddenly, Iggothuul froze, but the retina seemed fixated on them.<br><br>At that instant, Haley felt Jaden\u2019s trembling shoulder next to hers. She nudged him slightly and whispered, \u201cStop shaking, J-J. We\u2019re not out of this yet.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d<br><br>\u201cTry harder,\u201d Mahan approached the small window. \u201cI think it senses fear\u2026\u201d<br><br>Iggothuul edged closer, staring hard at them. Monstrous tentacles discharged glowing blue slime and slithered up and down the Fortress Tank like hungry eels.<br><br>\u201cJ-J\u2026 please\u2026 calm yourself...\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s God-damn Cthulhu! Don\u2019t tell me to calm myself.\u201d<br><br>Hailey released a calming breath. \u201cTry not to think about it. Just close your eyes and think of... sheep\u2026 count sheep or something\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cSheep?\u201d Jaden couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing, but he listened to her suggestion and closed his eyes. In his mind\u2019s eye he visualized sheep grazing in a peaceful meadow with a soft, calming melody he had once heard in an elevator. Then the elevator music stopped all at once. The sheep stopped eating and looked up to the sky as Iggothuul rose from the churning fog. With a terrible shriek, the horrible giant snatched all the sheep with its tentacles and crammed them into its hungry, salivating mouth, crushing skulls, bones, and bleating heads.<br><br>Instantly, Jaden\u2019s eyes snapped open. \u201cDoesn\u2019t work! All I\u2019m thinking about is\u2014\"<br><br>Iggothuul interrupted him with a loud roar and proceeded to slam the ground with frenzied tentacles.<br><br>Jaden stopped breathing and blinked as if he had just stepped into a morgue.<br><br>All three stared at the monstrous creature trying to understand what they were seeing. Iggothuul stopped slamming the ground and was motionless for a moment that felt like eternity. Then, slowly, as the three of them watched in relief, Iggothuul turned and slithered away, munching on scrap and bones and cadavers as it moved through the endless wasteland. They stared after the creature as it faded into thick clouds of insects and shapeless bird-things.<br><br>After a long silence, Jaden released a nervous laugh.<br><br>Mahan patted him on the back. \u201cI guess we\u2019re lucky it\u2019s only attracted to the lights.\u201d<br><br>Jaden turned to Haley. \u201cDon\u2019t ever tell me to count sheep again!\u201d<br><br>Haley\u2019s face broke into a smile and she was just about to laugh when she heard strange things crying like newborn babies in the thick black muck that had drained from the containers. Jaden followed her very serious gaze and was nearly knocked over by the scene before him. He asked in a voice rising with mingled terror and panic:<br><br>\u201cSomeone please tell me what the hell I\u2019m looking at?\u201d",

One thing is clear. Zzzzl understands the connection between thought and feeling to manifest reality. She has even found ways to hide secrets in the blood of her creations. She may even be one of the Unknowns who have hidden countless secrets throughout the realms.",

I shared the stable with several other horses and some crazy pigs and dogs. I was to be the till horse, but I was still too young and my legs just weren\u2019t ready for that kind of work. The farmer used to strap me to this cold, metal contraption that dug into my skin and I\u2019d pull or get beaten or have the dogs unleashed on me. Well, that wasn\u2019t so fair, and one dog got real smart with Roy, an old horse with the best jokes you ever heard, and Roy kicked that dog right in the teeth. Shattered them so he couldn\u2019t use them against me or any other animal. Even broke his neck bones. Farmer Jo whipped Roy until his arm got tired and Jo collapsed on account of all the shine he had been guzzling down. Farmer Jo got into a rhubarb over everything, and we all got our share of thrashings. Mean, no-good, bucket-head that one. But he got a taste of his own medicine in the end. I was watching the whole thing from a crack in the stable. All I remember is seeing Jo thrashing my friend Betty and screaming at the dogs to help him give her pain. She was tired and cold, and I was thinking that the dogs shouldn\u2019t go after Betty but Jo. And the funny thing was after I thought that the dogs did nothing. Absolutely nothing. And he was getting more and more upset. Then he turns his whip on the dogs and then I did it\u2014I wished one of them dogs would just teach him a lesson. Before I knew what was what one of the dogs turns on Farmer Jo and bites his leg and rips out a good meaty chunk of flesh. Now Jo yells and shrieks and tries to stand. But the dogs surrounded him and pounced, and the yells and shrieks turned to gurgles and the gurgles soon turned to silence. Then one of them dogs comes and frees us. Frees us all. As I made my way outside, I heard a series of gunshots and yelps. Suddenly all the animals went off in every direction to the dirt road, to the meadow, to the river and I galloped off to the forest. I rushed through trees and bramble and only stopped when I felt I was being followed. That\u2019s when I turned to see a litter of pups following me. I told them to scram and go find their mommy. I shooed them away and continued through pools of shadow and light but every time I glanced back, there they were, stumbling over bushes, logs or trying to hide from my angry gaze. I told them to quit following me that was that.",

An incandescent red moon hung boldly in the sky casting an eerie glow over clusters of crumbling stone homes. Small cooking fires flickered throughout the village with pots of blood boiling in the dark. Crimson blood and other fluids drained from a heap of bodies stacked up and left to ferment. In the pile she recognized several members of the Black Serpent clan, ripped and mangled and half devoured by maggots, chewed and rotting remnants of men and women just like she had read in one of the tomes.<br><br>This was the place.<br><br>This was definitely the place.<br><br>Black Serpent disciples had come here searching for the hidden secrets of the Unknowns to transcribe to their scrolls, and they had somehow met their demise at the claws of fanged creatures she didn\u2019t want to think about.<br><br>Vampires.<br><br>She despised vampires\u2014all manifestations of them throughout the countless realms.<br><br>Now Saku nudged Maurice to slow down as they searched the village for signs or symbols left behind by the Unknowns. Secret symbols she had read about in one of the many tomes she had salvaged from the abandoned towers. From these collected stories, she had been able to learn many secrets about this strange and horrific dimension in which she had been trapped and was trying desperately to escape. She had read the stories, the memories and the annotations, and she was sure this was the village\u2014the Village of the Vampires\u2014where the Unknowns had hidden secret knowledge on how to manipulate the fog.<br><br>\u201cBe wary of vampires,\u201d Saku whispered.<br><br>\u201cVampires?\u201d Maurice questioned. \u201cWhat do you mean, vampires? You didn\u2019t tell me there would be vampires. Are we talking the ones more like people, or are we talking the ones more like giant bats?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe ones more like beasts\u2026 beasts with wings.\u201d<br><br>\u201cJeeezzz\u2026 we\u2019re in a rhubarb now. I hate\u2014\u201d<br><br>A sudden shriek interrupted his words as massive winged creatures with glinting razor-sharp teeth came hurtling at them from the shadows. In a blinding blur of speed, Saku leaped into the sky, her blade gleaming as she sent claws, limbs and heads tumbling to the ground. When she landed, she didn\u2019t have time to think. She didn\u2019t even have time to breathe. Deadly claws swished over her head as she evaded wild attacks and countered with strategic swipes that left her assailants in pieces. Then she turned to see Maurice kicking and charging a vampire twice his size. Instantly, she charged toward them as the last remaining vampire smashed Maurice against a stone wall. The vampire hissed at Maurice and then suddenly turned to face Saku with its glowing red eyes.<br><br>Saku slowed to a stride. Her eyes held the glare of the vampire as it tried to intimidate her with a roar but\u2014<br><br>With a flash of her blade\u2014<br><br>The roar was choked with a vicious thrust of cold steel.<br><br>Blood gushed out like a geyser as the vampire collapsed to the ground clutching its throat.<br><br>Saku shook droplets of blood off her katana as she watched the vampire issue its last breath. Then she looked around the village, wondering where the Unknowns may have hidden their secrets. She didn\u2019t see any markings. She had no idea. But she knew that they hid knowledge in so many different ways it was hard if not impossible to keep track. It was at that moment Saku had an inspiration and remembered a detail from one of the stories she had read. Squatting, she used her blade to flay the skin off the vampire\u2019s arm, and though she expected to see luminous symbols in the fat and flesh, she saw nothing.<br><br>With a sigh, she stood to peer at a cluster of homes in the thickening fog. Maurice came up beside her and was just about to speak when she lifted a silencing finger. She could sense something was amiss. Gazing ahead, she listened to sounds only her keen ears could have caught: the scraping of claws on stone, the faint chattering of teeth, the rattle of a stone under a foot and the murmurings of vampires communicating in their strange language. Taking a small step forward, she realized the first attack had just been a test.<br><br>Instinctively, Saku held her katana at the ready as she looked deep into the shadows. When she lowered her gaze, the vampires attacked, but\u2014<br><br>Not fast enough.",

The pups ignored my every attempt to scare them away and followed me through the woods, across a meadow and all the way to the edge of a small town. I stood in the darkness staring at the glowing orange lights in the distance like fireflies. Tired, I laid down, closed my eyes and tried to forget everything at the farm. Then I started when I felt something small push against my side. I turned with eyes wide open to see the pups curling up beside me to keep warm. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stay away.\u201d \u201cYup,\u201d they each replied in turn. I sighed and closed my eyes, again. I was too tired to protest, and so I just wished them a good night. I dreamed of my mother and didn\u2019t want to wake up. I wanted to live in that dream. When I finally drifted back to reality, it was morning, and the pups were already gnawing on bones and slurping spaghetti and all kinds of other waste they had pulled out of someone\u2019s trash. I helped myself to a few rotten apples.<br><br>When I was done, I stood and told them quite frankly that I didn\u2019t know anything about dogs and that I didn\u2019t know what to do with them. And they answered it was okay because they didn\u2019t know anything about horses, and it probably didn\u2019t matter any which way. I released a deep breath and wondered what to do next when one of the pups suggested we go to the mountains. He figured we should get away from the town as we probably wouldn't be welcome. I figured he was probably right and that heading to the mountains wasn\u2019t such a bad idea.<br><br>And so, the pups charged for the mountains but stopped suddenly when they realized I was hesitating. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Boz?\u201d one of them asked. Then they all pleaded with me to follow them, each one calling me, \u2018Boz\u2019 on account they had mistaken me for another horse at the farm who quite frankly didn\u2019t even look like me. The whole way to the mountains I tried correcting them with regard to my real name. But it was pointless, and I figured what the hay, if they wanted to call me \u2018Boz\u2019 they could call me \u2018Boz.\u2019 There were worse things in life than being called the wrong name. Don\u2019t I know that now\u2026.<br><br>Anyway\u2026 back to the story.<br><br>It wasn\u2019t long before we were pushing up a mountain when the pups began to talk about their mum and all at once began to slow down as though they were walking through thick molasses. I didn\u2019t say anything, because there is nothing to say when you lose a parent. I just mentioned that their mum and my mum were together now looking out for us and that they would want us safe. One by one they agreed, and as we started up again, they told me they hadn\u2019t been named and that their mum was waiting for inspiration. And so, I promised I\u2019d name them all when I felt inspired just like their mum would have wanted. They seemed satisfied with that answer as we climbed up the mountain and approached a cave which seemed to be the perfect place to rest.<br><br>But just as soon as we neared the entrance one pup froze suddenly, warning us not to go in and swore that there was a great darkness inside. His brothers and sisters laughed and said that of course there was darkness inside. It was a cave! But he shook his head and said he meant something else\u2014something evil\u2014something evil like the old farmer. He then told us a story of men shooting each other up for money and moonshine. Well, despite his warning, I entered the cave, telling the pups to wait for me by the entrance. And just as soon as I stepped into the darkness, there it was. The smell. No, not a smell. A stench. A stench that hit me like a bag full of bricks and turned my guts inside out.<br><br>It took me a moment before I continued again. With careful steps I moved through shadows and dappled light coming from cracks above. The stench\u2014if you can believe it\u2014got even worse as I entered a small cavern with shiny equipment that dripped moonshine from bullet holes.<br><br>And that\u2019s when I saw it.<br><br>A heap of rotting bodies and blood-stained paper money scattered all over the ground just as the little one had described.<br><br>I backed out slowly, retracing my steps, trying to figure out how he had known.<br><br>I never did figure that one out, but I did figure out his name. I called him \u2018Trouble.\u2019 Not because he was trouble, but because he always knew if we were heading into trouble with his creepy premonitions.",

She stepped over the charred remains of hundreds of unlucky seekers who had found an untimely and gruesome end trying to enter the lost realm. She stared down at her map and the symbols she had discovered throughout her seemingly endless journey to find a way out of this living prison. She stared at the symbols and sighed sadly and wasn\u2019t sure what to do. She wished her friend was still with her. He would have ideas. He would know what to do. He had a much better understanding of this dark world than she ever did. He would know if she had chosen the right symbols and ordered the correct sequence. They had talked often about the past, and they had discussed the stories and the notes they had gathered, and he seemed to know what parts were relevant and what parts weren\u2019t.<br><br>But he wasn\u2019t with her anymore and there was nothing she could do about that now.<br><br>With a sigh, she collected a stone from the grasp of a skeleton, and she began to etch a sequence of nine symbols in the wall before her. She carved the sequence nine times and soon found herself staring at the arcane patterns waiting for something to happen. But nothing happened. At least, she thought, she was still alive. That meant she had etched the correct sequence. And then, remembering a moment in a story she had discarded as irrelevant, she heaved a deep breath and held it as she visualized a doorway that would lead her back home. Then she released her breath over the wall.<br><br>As Saku breathed life over the patterns, the symbols illuminated and white smokey mist suddenly rose from the ground to engulf her.<br><br>Moments later, the symbols faded, and the mist dissipated to reveal a doorway into the heart of the mountain. She stared at the doorway with disbelieving eyes. She had been waiting for this moment for what felt like an eternity. With cautious steps, she inched forward and gazed into the cavern beyond the doorway where a narrow bridge disappeared into an ocean of white mist.<br><br>Slowly, Saku entered the mountain and began to walk across the wooden bridge as tendrils of white mist seemed to attack her from both sides. Suddenly, sounds from her past emerged and seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Horrible sounds. Terrible sounds. Cries. Screams. Shrieks. She could even hear her mother\u2019s voice warning her to turn back while she still had a chance.<br><br>At once Saku froze and closed her eyes to compose herself. She breathed in deeply, and she slowly released her fears and doubts. As the hellish cacophony faded, she opened her eyes and continued forward in the almost perfect silence despite the tendrils that continued to lash out at her with every step. She walked for hours and perhaps even days before she finally realized she would die before she reached the end.<br><br>Perhaps there wasn\u2019t even an end to reach. Perhaps the bridge went on forever. Saku scrunched her fist and let out a moan of despair when she realized this was just another trial. Another way for this living prison to feed off her fears and anguish. She was trapped without hope. For several minutes she stood there as if she had been glued to the bridge. Every muscle in her body tensed. The loud sound of some sort of energy vibrating at a very high rate tormented her as the mist continued to lash out. The experience was unlike any she had ever undergone before. She could not think of a single move by which to continue her journey. But then a great calmness came over her as she saw something in the mist. Something that she hadn't noticed before. Something that had been there all along. The mist\u2026<br><br>It wasn\u2019t attacking her. It was... testing her.<br><br>Beckoning her.<br><br>Saku laughed out loud with the realization. The tendrils weren\u2019t a warning to stay out but an invitation to come in. She could see it clearly now, and she could see how they were trying to prevent her from continuing forward because\u2014<br><br>She was going the wrong way!<br><br>And so, she closed her eyes, cleared her mind, and with a fearless heart, she unsheathed her katana with a resounding ring and raised it high above her head. Then she sliced straight through the bridge and felt the world collapse beneath her feet.",

She hadn't planned to stop at this roadside shrine - she didn't even remember the shrine being at this spot along the canal in her youth - but something within compelled her to take a break here.<br><br>Grandmother used to tell a story about these foxes. Something that she claimed happened to her.<br><br>It happened in her youth, when life was at its darkest and the future seemed darker still. These kinds of foxes were always thought to be tricksters, but to her grandmother, it was a beacon. She came upon one of these foxes while she wandered the forest, lost, frightened. It beckoned her onward, unfurling its many tails to entice her deeper into the woods. She followed with a child's curiosity, feeling her fear wither away with each step.<br><br>That is, until the fox disappeared.<br><br>The fox had taken her far, far into the forest and left her alone, farther from home than she'd ever been before. As tears returned to her eyes, she could hear sobs that were not her own. The sound was coming closer, closer. Arms wrapped around her and carried her home.<br><br>Her mother, Yui's great-grandmother, insisted she wouldn't have searched so deep into the forest - her little girl would never go that far - but something was guiding her, telling her to keep going.<br><br>Yui heard the story so many times as a kid she'd have to hide her exasperation. But her father, who must have heard the story more than anyone could count, never seemed to tire of it.<br><br>Yui looks over her shoulders - the canal street is quiet - gives the fox shrine a subtle bow, and moves on.",

Now, he was stuck with them in some sort of post-apocalyptic hell. His plan had clearly backfired. His moonshine had poisoned them all and he was being punished. This was his own personal hell. To be stuck with The Dwyghts throughout eternity. Things, he was sure, couldn't get any worse. He cursed under his breath and kicked a stone violently. Then, as he watched The Dwyghts stumbling about the ruins, he suddenly realized their leader was missing.

It certainly wasn't honorable with its prolonged misery, apprehension, hunger, and incompetent officers ordering soldiers like sheep to the slaughter. And yet, killing came easy to Evan, easier than the other soldiers from his town. Evan seemed to enjoy hunting the enemy more than deer or any other game without understanding why. It seemed to satisfy a need he never knew he had until he defied his uncle and joined the war effort overseas. Now, there weren't many men left in the flooded, vermin-infested trench. They were all dead or dying from a day of endless raids and shellacking. Evan had made it clear to the others that he wasn't going to wait idly for death, and so he gathered volunteers to help him rush the enemy trench across No Man's Land. Fifteen men had followed him to the make-shift ladder. He gave them all a grave look as he pulled down a blood-covered mask he had fashioned out of bone and shrapnel to protect his face from bullets, debris, and poisonous gas. The soldier beside him heaved a deep breath and blew the whistle. At once, the soldiers followed Evan over the top. With incredible speed and determination, he evaded barbwire and bullets as he closed the distance. Fearlessly, he leaped into the enemy trench and took out the enemy gunner, then he turned to face enemy soldiers charging at him with rifles, swords and shovels, panicking and screaming in a language he didn\u2019t understand. And there, in the endless melee, Evan didn't stop kicking and stomping and bayoneting until a thick fog like molasses rose from the mud to engulf them all. When the fog dissipated, Evan and his men found themselves in another world\u2014a strange and uncanny world similar to one he had read about in a horror serial he had picked up at the train station. \"Where are we?\" one soldier finally asked, stepping beside Evan. A roar followed by an agonizing scream sounded in the distance. Evan lifted his mask and considered for a moment. \"Definitely not Oz...\" His voice died as he saw a giant creature with massive tentacles heading their way. Someone panicked and yelled something in German, but Evan couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the impossible creature advancing toward them.",
